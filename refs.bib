We present a case study in training a production-scale classifier of tree cover in remote sensing imagery, using early-generation quantum annealing hardware built by D-wave Systems, Inc. Beginning within a known boosting framework, we train decision stumps on texture features and vegetation indices extracted from four-band, one-meter-resolution aerial imagery from the state of California. We then impose a regulated quadratic training objective to select an optimal voting subset from among these stumps. The votes of the subset define the classifier. For optimization, the logical variables in the objective function map to quantum bits in the hardware device, while quadratic couplings encode as the strength of physical interactions between the quantum bits. Hardware design limits the number of couplings between these basic physical entities to five or six. To account for this limitation in mapping large problems to the hardware architecture, we propose a truncation and rescaling of the training objective through a trainable metaparameter. The boosting process on our basic 108- and 508-variable problems, thus constituted, returns classifiers that incorporate a diverse range of color- and texture-based metrics and discriminate tree cover with accuracies as high as 92{\%} in validation and 90{\%} on a test scene encompassing the open space preserves and dense suburban build of Mill Valley, CA.},

	Abstract = {We report on a case study in programming an early quantum annealer to attack optimization problems related to operational planning. While a number of studies have looked at the performance of quantum annealers on problems native to their architecture, and others have examined performance of select problems stemming from an application area, ours is one of the first studies of a quantum annealer's performance on parametrized families of hard problems from a practical domain. We explore two different general mappings of planning problems to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, and apply them to two parametrized families of planning problems, navigation-type and scheduling-type. We also examine two more compact, but problem-type specific, mappings to QUBO, one for the navigation-type planning problems and one for the scheduling-type planning problems. We study embedding properties and parameter setting and examine their effect on the efficiency with which the quantum annealer solves these problems. From these results, we derive insights useful for the programming and design of future quantum annealers: problem choice, the mapping used, the properties of the embedding, and the annealing profile all matter, each significantly affecting the performance.},

	N2 = {Recent progress implies that a crossover between machine learning and quantum information processing benefits both fields. Traditional machine learning has dramatically improved the benchmarking and control of experimental quantum computing systems, including adaptive quantum phase estimation and designing quantum computing gates. On the other hand, quantum mechanics offers tantalizing prospects to enhance machine learning, ranging from reduced computational complexity to improved generalization performance. The most notable examples include quantum enhanced algorithms for principal component analysis, quantum support vector machines, and quantum Boltzmann machines. Progress has been rapid, fostered by demonstrations of midsized quantum optimizers which are predicted to soon outperform their classical counterparts. Further, we are witnessing the emergence of a physical theory pinpointing the fundamental and natural limitations of learning. Here we survey the cutting edge of this merger and list several open problems.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach to interpret the prediction process of the BP-sLDA model, which is a supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model trained by Back Propagation over a deep architecture. The model is shown to achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance on several large-scale text analysis tasks. To interpret the prediction process of the model, often demanded by business data analytics applications, we perform evidence analysis on each pair-wise decision boundary over the topic distribution space, which is decomposed into a positive and a negative components. Then, for each element in the current document, a novel evidence score is defined by exploiting this topic decomposition and the generative nature of LDA. Then the score is used to rank the relative evidence of each element for the effectiveness of model prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a large-scale binary classification task on a corporate proprietary dataset with business-centric applications.},

	N2 = {In the near future, there will likely be special-purpose quantum computers with 40-50 high-quality qubits. This paper lays general theoretical foundations for how to use such devices to demonstrate "quantum supremacy": that is, a clear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the Extended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible. First, we study the hardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along the lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show that there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with sampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a statistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass. Compared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk directly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being sampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new algorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates in polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known algorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of Aaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem--of the form "if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then PH collapses"--must be non-relativizing. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson and Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant versus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities. Fifth, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work implies that, if OWFs exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to such oracles. We show that some assumption is needed: if SampBPP=SampBQP and NP is in BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to such oracles.},

	N2 = {Non-stoquastic Hamiltonians have both positive and negative signs in off-diagonal elements in their matrix representation in the standard computational basis and thus cannot be simulated efficiently by the standard quantum Monte Carlo method due to the sign problem. We describe our analytical studies of this type of Hamiltonians with infinite-range non-random as well as random interactions from the perspective of possible enhancement of the efficiency of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing. It is shown that non-stoquastic terms, of the type of multi-body transverse interactions like XX and XXX with positive coefficients, appended to the stoquastic Hamiltonian reduce a first-order quantum phase transition in the simple transverse-field Ising model to a second-order transition. This implies that the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced, because a first-order transition has an exponentially small energy gap (and therefore exponentially long computation time) whereas a second-order transition has a polynomially decaying gap (polynomial computation time). The examples presented here are the first instances where strong quantum effects, in the sense that they cannot be efficiently simulated in the standard quantum Monte Carlo, have analytically been shown to exponentially enhance the efficiency of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization problems.},

We prove that the partition function of any model in this family can be efficiently approximated to a given relative error E using a classical randomized algorithm with runtime polynomial in 1/E, system size, and inverse temperature. As a consequence we obtain a polynomial time algorithm which approximates the free energy or ground energy to a given additive error. We first show how to approximate the partition function by the perfect matching sum of a finite graph with positive edge weights. Although the perfect matching sum is not known to be efficiently approximable in general, the graphs obtained by our method have a special structure which facilitates efficient approximation via a randomized algorithm due to Jerrum and Sinclair.},

	N2 = {One of the main methods for protecting quantum information against decoherence is to encode information in the ground subspace (or the low energy sector) of a Hamiltonian with a large energy gap which penalizes errors from environment. The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate ground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the interaction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary number of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are local and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite number of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with respect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by a factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the norm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still evolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the context of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside the code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The result is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or their assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also prove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far from the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression. Our main technical tool is a new bound on the decay of power spectral density at high frequencies for local observables and many-body Hamiltonians with bounded and local interactions in a neighborhood around the support of the observable.},

	Abstract = {We study entanglement and other correlation properties of random states in high-dimensional bipartite systems. These correlations are quantified by parameters that are subject to the ``concentration of measure'' phenomenon, meaning that on a large-probability set these parameters are close to their expectation. For the entropy of entanglement, this has the counterintuitive consequence that there exist large subspaces in which all pure states are close to maximally entangled. This, in turn, implies the existence of mixed states with entanglement of formation near that of a maximally entangled state, but with negligible quantum mutual information and, therefore, negligible distillable entanglement, secret key, and common randomness. It also implies a very strong locking effect for the entanglement of formation: its value can jump from maximal to near zero by tracing over a number of qubits negligible compared to the size of the total system. Furthermore, such properties are generic. Similar phenomena are observed for random multiparty states, leading us to speculate on the possibility that the theory of entanglement is much simplified when restricted to asymptotically generic states. Further consequences of our results include a complete derandomization of the protocol for universal superdense coding of quantum states.},

	Abstract = {We show how to perform universal Hamiltonian and adiabatic computing using a time-independent Hamiltonian on a 2D grid describing a system of hopping particles which string together and interact to perform the computation. In this construction, the movement of one particle is controlled by the presence or absence of other particles, an effective quantum field effect transistor that allows the construction of controlled-NOT and controlled-rotation gates. The construction translates into a model for universal quantum computation with time-independent two-qubit ZZ and XX + YY interactions on an (almost) planar grid. The effective Hamiltonian is arrived at by a single use of first-order perturbation theory avoiding the use of perturbation gadgets. The dynamics and spectral properties of the effective Hamiltonian can be fully determined as it corresponds to a particular realization of a mapping between a quantum circuit and a Hamiltonian called the space--time circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction. Because of the simple interactions required, and because no higher-order perturbation gadgets are employed, our construction is potentially realizable using superconducting or other solid-state qubits.},

In this review we give an account of most of the major theoretical developments in the field, while focusing on the closed-system setting. The review is organized around a series of topics that are essential to an understanding of the underlying principles of AQC, its algorithmic accomplishments and limitations, and its scope in the more general setting of computational complexity theory. We present several variants of the adiabatic theorem, the cornerstone of AQC, and we give examples of explicit AQC algorithms that exhibit a quantum speedup. We give an overview of several proofs of the universality of AQC and related Hamiltonian quantum complexity theory. We finally devote considerable space to Stoquastic AQC, the setting of most AQC work to date, where we discuss obstructions to success and their possible resolutions.

	N2 = {We have developed a general technique to study the dynamics of the quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm applied to random combinatorial optimization problems in the asymptotic limit of large problem size $n$. We use as an example the NP-complete Number Partitioning problem and map the algorithm dynamics to that of an auxilary quantum spin glass system with the slowly varying Hamiltonian. We use a Green function method to obtain the adiabatic eigenstates and the minimum excitation gap, $g_{\rm min}={\cal O}(n 2^{-n/2})$, corresponding to the exponential complexity of the algorithm for Number Partitioning. The key element of the analysis is the conditional energy distribution computed for the set of all spin configurations generated from a given (ancestor) configuration by simulteneous fipping of a fixed number of spins. For the problem in question this distribution is shown to depend on the ancestor spin configuration only via a certain parameter related to the energy of the configuration. As the result, the algorithm dynamics can be described in terms of one-dimenssional quantum diffusion in the energy space. This effect provides a general limitation on the power of a quantum adiabatic computation in random optimization problems. Analytical results are in agreement with the numerical simulation of the algorithm.},

In this work we study the efficiency of the adiabatic algorithm for solving the "the Hamming weight with a spike" problem by using several methods to compute the scaling of the spectral gap at the critical point, which apply for various ranges of the height and width of the barrier. Our main result is a rigorous polynomial lower bound on the minimum spectral gap for the adiabatic evolution when the bit-symmetric cost function has a thin but polynomially high barrier. This is accomplished by the use of a variational argument with an improved ansatz for the ground state, along with a comparison to the spectrum of the system when no spike term is present. We also give a more detailed treatment of the spin coherent path-integral instanton method which was used by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann in},

Both techniques are probabilistic in nature and the minimum gap between the ground state and first excited state of the system during evolution is a major factor in determining the success probability. In this work we investigate a strategy for increasing the minimum gap and success probability by introducing intermediate Hamiltonians that modify the evolution path between initial and final Hamiltonians. We focus on an optimization problem relevant to recent hardware implementations and present numerical evidence for the existence of a purely local intermediate Hamiltonian that achieve the optimum performance in terms of pushing the minimum gap to one of the end points of the evolution. As a part of this study we develop a convex optimization formulation of the search for optimal adiabatic schedules that makes this computation more tractable, and which may be of independent interest. We further study the effectiveness of random intermediate Hamiltonians on the minimum gap and success probability, and empirically find that random Hamiltonians have a significant probability of increasing the success probability, but only by a modest amount.},

	N2 = {Machine learning applications are limited by computational power. In this paper, we gain novel insights into the application of quantum annealing (QA) to machine learning (ML) through experiments in natural language processing (NLP), seizure prediction, and linear separability testing. These experiments are performed on QA simulators and early-stage commercial QA hardware and compared to an unprecedented number of traditional ML techniques. We extend QBoost, an early implementation of a binary classifier that utilizes a quantum annealer, via resampling and ensembling of predicted probabilities to produce a more robust class estimator. To determine the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, resampled QBoost (RQBoost) is tested across several datasets and compared to QBoost and traditional ML. We show and explain how QBoost in combination with a commercial QA device are unable to perfectly separate binary class data which is linearly separable via logistic regression with shrinkage. We further explore the performance of RQBoost in the space of NLP and seizure prediction and find QA-enabled ML using QBoost and RQBoost is outperformed by traditional techniques. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion of algorithmic constraints and trade-offs imposed by the use of this QA hardware. Through these experiments, we provide unique insights into the state of quantum ML via boosting and the use of quantum annealing hardware that are valuable to institutions interested in applying QA to problems in ML and beyond.},

	N2 = {In an earlier work {$[$}14{$]$}, Ronagh et al. propose a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a constrained binary quadratic programming problem via quantum adiabatic evolution using an outer approximation method. This should be an efficient prescription for solving the Lagrangian dual problem in the presence of an ideally noise-free quantum adiabatic system. Current implementations of quantum annealing systems demand methods that are efficient at handling possible sources of noise. In this paper we consider a subgradient method for finding an optimal primal-dual pair for the Lagrangian dual of a polynomially constrained binary polynomial programming problem. We then study the quadratic stable set (QSS) problem as a case study. We see that this method applied to the QSS problem can be viewed as an instance-dependent penalty-term approach that avoids large penalty coefficients. Finally, we report our experimental results of using the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer and conclude that our approach helps this quantum processor to succeed more often in solving these problems compared to the usual penalty-term approaches.},

The failure of annealing dynamics to equilibrate on practical time scales is a well understood limitation, but does not always prevent a heuristically useful distribution from being generated. In this paper we evaluate several methods for determining a useful operational temperature range for annealers. We show that, even where distributions deviate from the Boltzmann distribution due to ergodicity breaking, these estimates can be useful. We introduce the concepts of local and global temperatures that are captured by different estimation methods. We argue that for practical application it often makes sense to analyze annealers that are subject to post-processing in order to isolate the macroscopic distribution deviations that are a practical barrier to their application.},

However, many of maximum likelihood estimation problems are nonconvex, and it is known that the EM algorithm fails to give the optimal estimate by being trapped by local optima. In order to deal with this difficulty, we propose a deterministic quantum annealing EM algorithm by introducing the mathematical mechanism of quantum fluctuations into the conventional EM algorithm because quantum fluctuations induce the tunnel effect and are expected to relax the difficulty of nonconvex optimization problems in the maximum likelihood estimation problems. We show a theorem that guarantees its convergence and give numerical experiments to verify its efficiency.},

	N2 = {I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state space) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches traditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm. Such protocols will have numerous advantages over simple quantum annealing. By using such searches the effect of problem mis-specification can be reduced, as only energy differences between the searched states will be relevant. The quantum annealing algorithm is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical numerical technique which is now obsolete. Hence, I explore two strategies to use an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization algorithms. Furthermore, I show how sequential calls to quantum annealers can be used to construct analogues of population annealing and parallel tempering which use quantum searches as subroutines.The techniques given here can be applied not only to optimization, but also to sampling. I examine the feasibility of these protocols on real devices and note that implementing such protocols should require minimal if any change to the current design of the flux qubit-based annealers by D-Wave Systems Inc.},

Use of the method results in a considerable improvement in success metrics even for problems with high-precision couplers and biases.

	Abstract = {The statistical physics approach to the number partioning problem, a classical NP-hard problem, is both simple and rewarding. Very basic notions and methods from statistical mechanics are enough to obtain analytical results for the phase boundary that separates the ``easy-to-solve''from the ``hard-to-solve''phase of the NPP as well as for the probability distributions of the optimal and sub-optimal solutions. In addition, it can be shown that solving a number partioning problem of size N to some extent corresponds to locating the minimum in an unsorted list of O(2N) numbers. Considering this correspondence it is not surprising that known heuristics for the partitioning problem are not significantly better than simple random search.},

@article{Borgs:2001rc,
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of partitioning n randomly chosen integers between 1 and 2m into two subsets such that the discrepancy, the absolute value of the difference of their sums, is minimized. A partition is called perfect if the optimum discrepancy is 0 when the sum of all n integers in the original set is even, or 1 when the sum is odd. Parameterizing the random problem in terms of κ=m/n, we prove that the problem has a phase transition at κ=1, in the sense that for κ<1, there are many perfect partitions with probability tending to 1 as n→∞, whereas for κ>1, there are no perfect partitions with probability tending to 1. Moreover, we show that this transition is first-order in the sense the derivative of the so-called entropy is discontinuous at κ=1. We also determine the finite-size scaling window about the transition point: κn=1−(2n)−1 log2 n+λn/n, by showing that the probability of a perfect partition tends to 1, 0, or some explicitly computable p(λ)∈(0, 1), depending on whether λn tends to −∞, ∞, or λ∈(−∞, ∞), respectively. For λn→−∞fast enough, we show that the number of perfect partitions is Gaussian in the limit. For λn→∞, we prove that with high probability the optimum partition is unique, and that the optimum discrepancy is Θ(2 λn). Within the window, i.e., if {$|$}λn{$|$} is bounded, we prove that the optimum discrepancy is bounded. Both for λn→∞and within the window, we find the limiting distribution of the (scaled) discrepancy. Finally, both for the integer partitioning problem and for the continuous partitioning problem, we find the joint distribution of the k smallest discrepancies above the scaling window. {\copyright}2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	Abstract = {We introduce quantum fluctuations into the simulated annealing process of optimization problems, aiming at faster convergence to the optimal state. Quantum fluctuations cause transitions between states and thus play the same role as thermal fluctuations in the conventional approach. The idea is tested by the transverse Ising model, in which the transverse field is a function of time similar to the temperature in the conventional method. The goal is to find the ground state of the diagonal part of the {Hamiltonian} with high accuracy as quickly as possible. We have solved the time-dependent Schr{\~A}¶dinger equation numerically for small size systems with various exchange interactions. Comparison with the results of the corresponding classical (thermal) method reveals that the quantum annealing leads to the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use the same annealing schedule.},

	Abstract = {Codeword-stabilized quantum codes provide a unified approach to constructing quantum error-correcting codes, including both additive and nonadditive quantum codes. Standard codeword-stabilized quantum codes encode quantum information into subspaces. The more general notion of encoding quantum information into a subsystem is known as an operator (or subsystem) quantum error-correcting code. Most operator codes studied to date are based in the usual stabilizer formalism. We introduce operator quantum codes based on the codeword-stabilized quantum code framework. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for operator quantum error correction, we derive an error-correction condition for operator codeword-stabilized quantum codes. Based on this condition, the word operators of a operator codeword-stabilized quantum code are constructed from a set of classical binary errors induced by generators of the gauge group. We use this scheme to construct examples of both additive and nonadditive codes that encode quantum information into a subsystem.},

An intuition from quantum many-body physics suggests that an area law should hold whenever there is exponential decay of correlations in the system, a property found, for instance, in non-critical phases of matter. However, the existence of quantum data-hiding states{$[$}mdash{$]$}that is, states having very small correlations, yet a volume scaling of entanglement{$[$}mdash{$]$}was believed to be a serious obstruction to such an implication. Here we prove that notwithstanding the phenomenon of data hiding, one-dimensional quantum many-body states satisfying exponential decay of correlations always fulfil an area law. To obtain this result we combine several recent advances in quantum information theory, thus showing the usefulness of the field for addressing problems in other areas of physics.},

	Abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group method has been extensively used to study the ground state of 1D many-body systems since its introduction two decades ago. In spite of its wide use, this heuristic method is known to fail in certain cases and no certifiably correct implementation is known, leaving researchers faced with an ever-growing toolbox of heuristics, none of which is guaranteed to succeed. Here we develop a polynomial time algorithm that provably finds the ground state of any 1D quantum system described by a gapped local Hamiltonian with constant ground-state energy. The algorithm is based on a framework that combines recently discovered structural features of gapped 1D systems with an efficient construction of a class of operators called approximate ground-state projections (AGSPs). The combination of these tools yields a method that is guaranteed to succeed in all 1D gapped systems. An AGSP-centric approach may help guide the search for algorithms for more general quantum systems, including for the central challenge of 2D systems, where even heuristic methods have had more limited success.},

The required measurement accuracy scales inverse polynomially with the size of the simulated quantum circuit. This shows that the implementation of energy measurements on generic qudit chains is as hard as the realization of quantum computation. Here, a 'measurement' is any procedure that samples from the spectral measurement induced by the observable and the state under consideration.

	N2 = {Quantum annealing is a heuristic quantum algorithm which exploits quantum resources to minimize an objective function embedded as the energy levels of a programmable physical system. To take advantage of a potential quantum advantage, one needs to be able to map the problem of interest to the native hardware with reasonably low overhead. Because experimental considerations constrain our objective function to take the form of a low degree PUBO (polynomial unconstrained binary optimization), we employ non-convex loss functions which are polynomial functions of the margin. We show that these loss functions are robust to label noise and provide a clear advantage over convex methods. These loss functions may also be useful for classical approaches as they compile to regularized risk expressions which can be evaluated in constant time with respect to the number of training examples.},

The design is guided by the intention of solving the resulting problem by adiabatic quantum optimization. Two requirements are imposed by the engineering constraints of existing quantum hardware: training problems are formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization; and model parameters are represented as binary expansions of low bit-depth. In the present work we validate this approach by using a heuristic classical solver as a stand-in for quantum hardware. Testing on several popular data sets and comparing with a number of existing losses we find substantial advantages in robustness as measured by test error under increasing label noise. Robustness is enabled by the non-convexity of our hardware-compatible loss function, which we name q-loss.},

This has the interesting consequence that enabling human-level capability in machines often requires systems that can handle formally intractable problems. This issue can sometimes (but possibly not always) be resolved by building special-purpose heuristic algorithms, tailored to the problem in question. Because of the continued difficulties in automating certain tasks that are natural for humans, there remains a strong motivation for AI researchers to investigate and apply new algorithms and techniques to hard AI problems. Recently a novel class of relevant algorithms that require quantum mechanical hardware have been proposed. These algorithms, referred to as quantum adiabatic algorithms, represent a new approach to designing both complete and heuristic solvers for NP-hard optimization problems. In this work we describe how to formulate image recognition, which is a canonical NP-hard AI problem, as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem.

	N2 = {Non-stoquastic Hamiltonians have both positive and negative signs in off-diagonal elements in their matrix representation in the standard basis and thus cannot be simulated efficiently by the standard quantum Monte Carlo method due to the sign problem. We review our analytical studies of this type of Hamiltonians with infinite-range non-random and random interactions from the perspective of possible enhancement of the efficiency of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing. It is shown that non-stoquastic terms, of the type of multi-body transverse interactions like XX and XXX with positive coefficients, appended to the stoquastic Hamiltonian reduce a first-order quantum phase transition in the simple transverse-field Ising model to a second-order transition. This implies that the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced, because a first-order transition has an exponentially small energy gap (and therefore exponentially long computation time) whereas a second-order transition has a polynomially decaying gap (polynomial computation time). The examples presented here are the first instances where strong quantum effects, in the sense that they cannot be efficiently simulated in the standard quantum Monte Carlo, have analytically been shown to exponentially enhance the efficiency of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization problems.},

	Abstract = {Understanding NP-complete problems is a central topic in computer science (NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time). This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer's Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.},

	Abstract = {A promising approach to solving hard binary optimization problems is quantum adiabatic annealing in a transverse magnetic field. An instantaneous ground state{$[$}mdash{$]$}initially a symmetric superposition of all possible assignments of N qubits{$[$}mdash{$]$}is closely tracked as it becomes more and more localized near the global minimum of the classical energy. Regions where the energy gap to excited states is small (for instance at the phase transition) are the algorithm/'s bottlenecks. Here I show how for large problems the complexity becomes dominated by O(log N) bottlenecks inside the spin-glass phase, where the gap scales as a stretched exponential. For smaller N, only the gap at the critical point is relevant, where it scales polynomially, as long as the phase transition is second order. This phenomenon is demonstrated rigorously for the two-pattern Gaussian Hopfield model. Qualitative comparison with the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model leads to similar conclusions.},

	N2 = {Physical constraints make it challenging to implement and control multi-body interactions. For this reason, designing quantum information processes with Hamiltonians consisting of only one- and two-local terms is a worthwhile challenge. A common approach to robust storage of quantum information is to encode it in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian. Even allowing particles with high Hilbert-space dimension, it is impossible to protect quantum information from single-site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any Hamiltonian containing only commuting two-local terms. Here, we demonstrate how to get around this no-go result by encoding in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian consisting of non-commuting two-local terms arising from the gauge operators of a subsystem code. Specifically, we show how to protect stored quantum information against single-qubit errors using a Hamiltonian consisting of sums of the gauge generators from Bacon-Shor codes and generalized-Bacon-Shor code. Our results imply that non-commuting two-local Hamiltonians have more error-suppressing power than commuting two-local Hamiltonians. Finally, we comment briefly on the robustness of the whole scheme.},

	N2 = {There is increasing interest in the potential advantages of using quantum computing technologies as sampling engines to speedup machine learning and probabilistic programming tasks. However, some pressing challenges in state-of-the-art quantum annealers have to be overcome before we can assess their actual performance. Most notably, the effective temperature at which samples are generated is instance-dependent and unknown, the interaction graph is sparse, the parameters are noisy, and the dynamic range of the parameters is finite. Of all these limitations, the sparse connectivity resulting from the local interaction between quantum bits in physical hardware implementations, is considered the most severe limitation to the quality of constructing powerful machine learning models. Here we show how to surpass this "curse of limited connectivity" bottleneck and illustrate our findings by training probabilistic generative models with arbitrary pairwise connectivity. Our model can be trained in quantum hardware without full knowledge of the effective parameters specifying the corresponding Boltzmann-like distribution. Therefore, inference of the effective temperature is avoided and the effect of noise in the parameters is mitigated. We illustrate our findings by successfully training hardware-embedded models with all-to-all connectivity on a real dataset of handwritten digits and two synthetic datasets. In each of these datasets we show the generative capabilities of the models learned with the assistance of the quantum annealer in experiments with up to 940 quantum bits. Additionally, we show a visual Turing test with handwritten digit data, where the machine generating the digits is a quantum processor. Such digits, with a remarkable similarity to those generated by humans, are extracted from the experiments with 940 quantum bits.},

The Hamiltonian is determined by a choice of graph that specifies the geometry in which the particles move and interact. We prove that approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on a graph at fixed particle number is QMA-complete. In our QMA-hardness proof, we encode the history of an n-qubit computation in the subspace with at most one particle per site (i.e., hard-core bosons). This feature, along with the well-known mapping between hard-core bosons and spin systems, lets us prove a related result for a class of 2-local Hamiltonians defined by graphs that generalizes the XY model. By avoiding the use of perturbation theory in our analysis, we circumvent the need to multiply terms in the Hamiltonian by large coefficients.},

	N2 = {We consider the adiabatic quantum algorithm for systems with "no sign problem", such as the transverse field Ising mode, and analyze the equilibration time for quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) on these systems. We ask: if the spectral gap is only inverse polynomially small, will equilibration methods based on slowly changing the Hamiltonian parameters in the QMC simulation succeed in a polynomial time? We show that this is not true, by constructing counter-examples. Some examples are Hamiltonians where the space of configurations where the wavefunction has non-negligible amplitude has a nontrivial fundamental group, causing the space of trajectories in imaginary time to break into disconnected components, with only negligible probability outside these components. For the simplest example we give with an abelian fundamental group, QMC does not equilibrate but still solves the optimization problem. More severe effects leading to failure to solve the optimization can occur when the fundamental group is a free group on two generators. Other examples where QMC fails have a trivial fundamental group, but still use ideas from topology relating group presentations to simplicial complexes. We define gadgets to realize these Hamiltonians as the effective low-energy dynamics of a transverse field Ising model. We present some analytic results on equilibration times which may be of some independent interest in the theory of equilibration of Markov chains. Conversely, we show that a small spectral gap implies slow equilibration at low temperature for some initial conditions and for a natural choice of local QMC updates.},

	N2 = {In this thesis, I investigate aspects of local Hamiltonians in quantum computing. First, I focus on the Adiabatic Quantum Computing model, based on evolution with a time dependent Hamiltonian. I show that to succeed using AQC, the Hamiltonian involved must have local structure, which leads to a result about eigenvalue gaps from information theory. I also improve results about simulating quantum circuits with AQC. Second, I look at classically simulating time evolution with local Hamiltonians and finding their ground state properties. I give a numerical method for finding the ground state of translationally invariant Hamiltonians on an infinite tree. This method is based on imaginary time evolution within the Matrix Product State ansatz, and uses a new method for bringing the state back to the ansatz after each imaginary time step. I then use it to investigate the phase transition in the transverse field Ising model on the Bethe lattice. Third, I focus on locally constrained quantum problems Local Hamiltonian and Quantum Satisfiability and prove several new results about their complexity. Finally, I define a Hamiltonian Quantum Cellular Automaton, a continuous-time model of computation which doesn't require control during the computation process, only preparation of product initial states. I construct two of these, showing that time evolution with a simple, local, translationally invariant and time-independent Hamiltonian can be used to simulate quantum circuits.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies quantum Arthur--Merlin games, which are Arthur--Merlin games in which Arthur and Merlin can perform quantum computations and Merlin can send Arthur quantum information. As in the classical case, messages from Arthur to Merlin are restricted to be strings of uniformly generated random bits. It is proved that for one-message quantum Arthur--Merlin games, which correspond to the complexity class QMA, completeness and soundness errors can be reduced exponentially without increasing the length of Merlin's message. Previous constructions for reducing error required a polynomial increase in the length of Merlin's message. Applications of this fact include a proof that logarithmic length quantum certificates yield no increase in power over BQP and a simple proof that                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}text{\{}QMA{\}}{\}} {$\backslash$}subseteq {\{}{$\backslash$}text{\{}PP{\}}{\}}.{\$}{\$}                 Other facts that are proved include the equivalence of three (or more) message quantum Arthur--Merlin games with ordinary quantum interactive proof systems and some basic properties concerning two-message quantum Arthur--Merlin games.},

The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

@article{Aharonov:2009tm,
	Abstract = {We study the computational strength of quantum particles (each of finite dimensionality) arranged on a line. First, we prove that it is possible to perform universal adiabatic quantum computation using a one-dimensional quantum system (with 9 states per particle). This might have practical implications for experimentalists interested in constructing an adiabatic quantum computer. Building on the same construction, but with some additional technical effort and 12 states per particle, we show that the problem of approximating the ground state energy of a system composed of a line of quantum particles is QMA-complete; QMA is a quantum analogue of NP. This is in striking contrast to the fact that the analogous classical problem, namely, one-dimensional MAX-2-SAT with nearest neighbor constraints, is in P. The proof of the QMA-completeness result requires an additional idea beyond the usual techniques in the area: Not all illegal configurations can be ruled out by local checks, so instead we rule out such illegal configurations because they would, in the future, evolve into a state which can be seen locally to be illegal. Our construction implies (assuming the quantum Church-Turing thesis and that quantum computers cannot efficiently solve QMA-complete problems) that there are one-dimensional systems which take an exponential time to relax to their ground states at any temperature, making them candidates for being one-dimensional spin glasses.},

@article{boixo_eigenpath_2009,
	Abstract = {A computation in adiabatic quantum computing is implemented by traversing a path of nondegenerate eigenstates of a continuous family of Hamiltonians. We introduce a method that traverses a discretized form of the path: At each step we apply the instantaneous Hamiltonian for a random time. The resulting decoherence approximates a projective measurement onto the desired eigenstate, achieving a version of the quantum Zeno effect. If negative evolution times can be implemented with constant overhead, then the average absolute evolution time required by our method is O(L {square/Delta)} for constant error probability, where L is the length of the path of eigenstates and Delta is the minimum spectral gap of the Hamiltonian. Making explicit the dependence on the path length is useful for cases where L does not depend on Delta. The complexity of our method has a logarithmic improvement over previous algorithms of this type. The same cost applies to the discrete-time case, where a family of unitary operators is given and each unitary and its inverse can be used. Restriction to positive evolution times incurs an error that decreases exponentially with the cost. Applications of this method to unstructured search and quantum sampling are considered. In particular, we discuss the quantum simulated annealing algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up in the gap of the stochastic matrix over its classical counterpart implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo.},

This graph is a fascinating object of study: it has several hundred million nodes today, over a billion links, and appears to grow exponentially with time. There are many reasons -- mathematical, sociological, and commercial -- for studying the evolution of this graph. In this paper we begin by describing two algorithms that operate on the Web graph, addressing problems from Web search and automatic community discovery. We then report a number of measurements and properties of this graph that manifested themselves as we ran these algorithms on the Web. Finally, we observe that traditional random graph models do not explain these observations, and we propose a new family of random graph models. These models point to a rich new sub-field of the study of random graphs, and raise questions about the analysis of graph algorithms on the Web.}},

	Abstract = {{Recently, Barab\'{a}si and Albert [2] suggested modeling complex real-world networks such as the worldwide web as follows:consider a random graph process in which vertices are added to the graph one at a time and joined to a fixed number of earlier vertices, selected with probabilities proportional to their degrees. In [2] and, with Jeong, in [3], Barab\'{a}si and Albert suggested that after many steps the proportion P�d � of vertices with degree d should obey a power law P�d � α d −γ. They obtained γ = 2�9 $\pm$ 0�1 by experiment and gave a simple heuristic argument suggesting that γ = 3. Here we obtain P�d � asymptotically for all d ≤ n 1/15, where n is the number of vertices, proving as a consequence that γ = 3.}},

	Abstract = {{Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}},

	N2 = {Keeping a quantum system in a given instantaneous eigenstate is a control problem with numerous applications, e.g., in quantum information processing. The problem is even more challenging in the setting of open quantum systems, where environment-mediated transitions introduce additional decoherence channels. Adiabatic passage is a well established solution, but requires a sufficiently slow evolution time that is dictated by the adiabatic theorem. Here we develop a systematic projection theory formulation for the transitionless evolution of general open quantum systems described by time-local master equations. We derive a time-convolutionless dynamical equation for the target instantaneous eigenstate of a given time-dependent Hamiltonian. A transitionless dynamics then arises in terms of a competition between the average Hamiltonian gap and the decoherence rate, which implies optimal adiabaticity timescales. We show how eigenstate tracking can be accomplished via control pulses, without explicitly incorporating counter-diabatic driving, thus offering an alternative route to shortcuts to adiabaticity. We examine rectangular pulses, chaotic signals, and white noise, and find that, remarkably, the effectiveness of eigenstate tracking hardly depends on the details of the control functions. In all cases the control protocol keeps the system in the desired instantaneous eigenstate throughout the entire evolution, along an accelerated adiabatic path.},

	N2 = {In a previous publication we proposed discrete global optimization as a method to train a strong binary classifier constructed as a thresholded sum over weak classifiers. Our motivation was to cast the training of a classifier into a format amenable to solution by the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Applying adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) promises to yield solutions that are superior to those which can be achieved with classical heuristic solvers. Interestingly we found that by using heuristic solvers to obtain approximate solutions we could already gain an advantage over the standard method AdaBoost. In this communication we generalize the baseline method to large scale classifier training. By large scale we mean that either the cardinality of the dictionary of candidate weak classifiers or the number of weak learners used in the strong classifier exceed the number of variables that can be handled effectively in a single global optimization. For such situations we propose an iterative and piecewise approach in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected in each iteration via global optimization. The strong classifier is then constructed by concatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We show in numerical studies that the generalized method again successfully competes with AdaBoost. We also provide theoretical arguments as to why the proposed optimization method, which does not only minimize the empirical loss but also adds L0-norm regularization, is superior to versions of boosting that only minimize the empirical loss. By conducting a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation we gather evidence that the quantum adiabatic algorithm is able to handle a generic training problem efficiently.},

	N2 = {This paper describes how to make the problem of binary classification amenable to quantum computing. A formulation is employed in which the binary classifier is constructed as a thresholded linear superposition of a set of weak classifiers. The weights in the superposition are optimized in a learning process that strives to minimize the training error as well as the number of weak classifiers used. No efficient solution to this problem is known. To bring it into a format that allows the application of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC), we first show that the bit-precision with which the weights need to be represented only grows logarithmically with the ratio of the number of training examples to the number of weak classifiers. This allows to effectively formulate the training process as a binary optimization problem. Solving it with heuristic solvers such as tabu search, we find that the resulting classifier outperforms a widely used state-of-the-art method, AdaBoost, on a variety of benchmark problems. Moreover, we discovered the interesting fact that bit-constrained learning machines often exhibit lower generalization error rates. Changing the loss function that measures the training error from 0-1 loss to least squares maps the training to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. This corresponds to the format required by D-Wave's implementation of AQC. Simulations with heuristic solvers again yield results better than those obtained with boosting approaches. Since the resulting quadratic binary program is NP-hard, additional gains can be expected from applying the actual quantum processor.},

@article{Perdomo-Ortiz:2011fh,
	Abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) is a universal model for quantum computation which seeks to transform the initial ground state of a quantum system into a final ground state encoding the answer to a computational problem. AQC initial Hamiltonians conventionally have a uniform superposition as ground state. We diverge from this practice by introducing a simple form of heuristics: the ability to start the quantum evolution with a state which is a guess to the solution of the problem. With this goal in mind, we explain the viability of this approach and the needed modifications to the conventional AQC (CAQC) algorithm. By performing a numerical study on hard-to-satisfy 6 and 7 bit random instances of the satisfiability problem (3-SAT), we show how this heuristic approach is possible and we identify that the performance of the particular algorithm proposed is largely determined by the Hamming distance of the chosen initial guess state with respect to the solution. Besides the possibility of introducing educated guesses as initial states, the new strategy allows for the possibility of restarting a failed adiabatic process from the measured excited state as opposed to restarting from the full superposition of states as in CAQC. The outcome of the measurement can be used as a more refined guess state to restart the adiabatic evolution. This concatenated restart process is another heuristic that the CAQC strategy cannot capture.},

	Abstract = {In this review we consider the performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm for the solution of decision problems. We divide the possible failure mechanisms into two sets: small gaps due to quantum phase transitions and small gaps due to avoided crossings inside a phase. We argue that the thermodynamic order of the phase transitions is not predictive of the scaling of the gap with the system size. On the contrary, we also argue that, if the phase surrounding the problem Hamiltonian is a Many-Body Localized (MBL) phase, the gaps are going to be typically exponentially small and that this follows naturally from the existence of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase.},

However, it was not shown whether such a path could be found easily. Here, we give a simple construction that deterministically eliminates all such anticrossings in polynomial time, space and energy, for any Ising models with polynomial final gap. Thus, in order for adiabatic quantum optimization to require exponential time to solve any NP-complete problem, some quality other than this type of anticrossing must be unavoidable and necessitate exponentially long runtimes.},

The input of the problem is a family of pairwise commuting Hermitian operators H_1,...,H_r on a Hilbert space (C^d)^{\otimes n} and a string of real numbers h_1,...,h_r. The problem is to determine whether a common eigenspace specified by equalities (H_a - h_a)|\psi>=0, a=1,...,r, has a positive dimension. We consider two cases: (i) all operators H_a are k-local; (ii) all operators H_a are factorized. It can be easily shown that both problems belong to the class QMA - the quantum analogue of NP, and that some NP-complete problems can be reduced to either (i) or (ii). A non-trivial question is whether the problems (i) or (ii) belong to NP? We show that the answer is positive for some special values of k and d. Also we prove that the problem (ii) can be reduced to its special case, such that all operators H_a are factorized projectors and all h_a=0.},

However, the precise role of quantum effects, such as entanglement, in these optimization protocols is still unclear. We propose a setup of cold trapped ions that allows one to quantitatively characterize, in a controlled experiment, the interplay of entanglement, decoherence, and non-adiabaticity in adiabatic quantum optimization. We show that, in this way, a broad class of NP-complete problems becomes accessible for quantum simulations, including the knapsack problem, number partitioning, and instances of the max-cut problem. Moreover, a general theoretical study reveals correlations of the success probability with entanglement at the end of the protocol. From exact numerical simulations for small systems and linear ramps, however, we find no substantial correlations with the entanglement during the optimization. For the final state, we derive analytically a universal upper bound for the success probability as a function of entanglement, which can be measured in experiment. The proposed trapped-ion setups and the presented study of entanglement address pertinent questions of adiabatic quantum optimization, which may be of general interest across experimental platforms.},

This quantum adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum computing. We tested one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated hard instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we could simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well, providing evidence that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems.},

	Abstract = {We give a quantum algorithm for solving instances of the satisfiability problem, based on adiabatic evolution. The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

Because it requires polished code, it consumes time and energy that could be better spent doing more experiments. This article argues that a more scientific approach of controlled experimentation, similar to that used in other empirical sciences, avoids or alleviates these problems.

	Abstract = {Abstract We present several efficient implementations of the simulated annealing algorithm for Ising spin glasses on sparse graphs. In particular, we provide a generic code for any choice of couplings, an optimised code for bipartite graphs, and highly optimised implementations using multi-spin coding for graphs with small maximum degree and discrete couplings with a finite range. The latter codes achieve up to 50 spin flips per nanosecond on modern Intel CPUs. We also compare the performance of the codes to that of the special purpose D-Wave devices built for solving such Ising spin glass problems.

This is often the case in local search based heuristics for combinatorial optimization, such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, iterated local search, tabu search, WalkSAT, and GRASP. Such plots are very useful in the comparison of different algorithms or strategies for solving a given problem and have been widely used as a tool for algorithm design and comparison. We first discuss how TTT plots are generated. This is followed by a description of the perl program tttplots.pl.},

This involves encoding the Hamiltonian performing the computation using an error detecting subsystem code and the addition of a penalty term that commutes with the encoded Hamiltonian. The scheme is general and includes the stabilizer formalism of both subspace and subsystem codes as special cases. We derive performance bounds and show that complete error suppression results in the large penalty limit. To illustrate the power of subsystem-based error suppression, we introduce fully 2-local constructions for protection of the swap gate of adiabatic gate teleportation and the Ising chain in a transverse field.},

	N2 = {One of the main methods for protecting quantum information against decoherence is to encode information in the ground subspace (or the low energy sector) of a Hamiltonian with a large energy gap which penalizes errors from environment. The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate ground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the interaction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary number of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are local and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite number of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with respect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by a factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the norm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still evolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the context of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside the code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The result is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or their assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also prove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far from the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression. Our main technical tool is a new bound on the decay of power spectral density at high frequencies for local observables and many-body Hamiltonians with bounded and local interactions in a neighborhood around the support of the observable.},

We show that the proposed algorithm is exponentially faster than its classical counterpart and has the same complexity as the corresponding circuit-based algorithm. Together with other related studies, this result supports a conjecture that the complexity of adiabatic quantum computation is equivalent to the circuit-based computational model in a stronger sense than the well-known, proven polynomial equivalence between the two paradigms. We also discuss the importance of the algorithm and its theoretical and experimental implications for the existence of an adiabatic version of Shor's integer factorization algorithm that would have the same complexity as the original algorithm.},

	Abstract = {We introduce quantum versions of the $\chi$ 2 -divergence, provide a detailed analysis of their properties, and apply them in the investigation of mixing times of quantum Markov processes. An approach similar to the one presented in the literature for classical Markov chains is taken to bound the trace-distance from the steady state of a quantum processes. A strict spectral bound to the convergence rate can be given for time-discrete as well as for time-continuous quantum Markov processes. Furthermore, the contractive behavior of the $\chi$ 2 -divergence under the action of a completely positive map is investigated and contrasted to the contraction of the trace norm. In this context we analyze different versions of quantum detailed balance and, finally, give a geometric conductance bound to the convergence rate for unital quantum Markov processes.},

	Abstract = {We construct lower bounds to the spectral gap of a family of Lindblad generators known as Davies maps. These maps describe the thermalization of quantum systems weakly coupled to a heat bath. The steady state of these systems is given by the Gibbs distribution with respect to the system Hamiltonian. The bounds can be evaluated explicitly, when the eigenbasis and the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is known. A crucial assumption is that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we provide a counterexample to the conjecture, that the convergence rate is always determined by the gap of the associated Pauli master equation. We conclude that the full dynamics of the Lindblad generator has to be considered. Finally, we present several physical example systems for which the bound to the spectral gap is evaluated.},

	Abstract = {We provide an analysis of the correlation properties of spin and fermionic systems on a lattice evolving according to open system dynamics generated by a local primitive Liouvillian. We show that if the Liouvillian has a spectral gap which is independent of the system size, then the correlations between local observables decay exponentially as a function of the distance between their supports. We prove, furthermore, that if the Log-Sobolev constant is independent of the system size, then the system satisfies clustering of correlations in the mutual information{\textemdash}a much more stringent form of correlation decay. As a consequence, in the latter case we get an area law (with logarithmic corrections) for the mutual information. As a further corollary, we obtain a stability theorem for local distant perturbations. We also demonstrate that gapped free-fermionic systems exhibit clustering of correlations in the covariance and in the mutual information. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for the classical simulation of open quantum systems with matrix-product operators and the robust dissipative preparation of topologically ordered states of lattice spin systems.},

	N2 = {Fast adiabatic cooling procedures have important implications for the attainability of absolute zero. While traditionally adiabatically cooling a system is associated with slow thermal processes, for the parametric quantum harmonic oscillator fast frictionless processes are known, which transfer a system from an initial thermal equilibrium at one temperature into thermal equilibrium at another temperature. This makes such systems special tools in analyzing the bounds on fast cooling procedures. Previous discussions of those systems used frictionless cooling assuming real frequencies of the oscillator. Using a control with imaginary frequencies (repulsive potential) revises previous implications for the possible operation of a quantum refrigerator. Here we discuss these requisite revisions in the context of the third law of thermodynamics. In addition to minimum time controls, which are always of the bang-bang form, fast frictionless processes with a continuous variation of the frequency have been presented previously in the literature. Such continuous variation controls have been experimentally verified by cooling a Bose-Einstein condensate, while minimum time controls still await verification. As some implementations may indeed not be able to implement the instantaneous jumps in frequency required by bang-bang controls, constraining the rate of change in the frequency calls for ramped bang-bang solutions. We present such solutions and compare their performance to the continuous controls used in the experiment.},

	N2 = {Quantum control is concerned with active manipulation of physical and chemical processes on the atomic and molecular scale. This work presents a perspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing the evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early developments to the most recent advances. Among numerous theoretical insights and technological improvements that produced the present state-of-the-art in quantum control, there have been several breakthroughs of foremost importance. On the technology side, the current experimental successes would be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser sources and pulse shapers. On the theory side, the two most critical insights were (i) realizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via manipulation of quantum interferences and (ii) understanding that optimally shaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the desired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these theoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial concept of adaptive feedback control (AFC), which is a laboratory procedure employing measurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of femtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the desired objective. Optimization in AFC experiments is guided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be especially effective. AFC of quantum phenomena has found numerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and this paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include quantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of theoretical control designs in experimental realizations and real-time quantum feedback control. The paper concludes with a perspective of open research directions that are likely to attract significant attention in the future.},

@article{Grebogi:1983ao,
	Abstract = {The occurrence of sudden qualitative changes of chaotic dynamics as a parameter is varied is discussed and illustrated. It is shown that such changes may result from the collision of an unstable periodic orbit and a coexisting chaotic attractor. We call such collisions crises. Phenomena associated with crises include sudden changes in the size of chaotic attractors, sudden appearances of chaotic attractors (a possible route to chaos), and sudden destructions of chaotic attractors and their basins. This paper presents examples illustrating that crisis events are prevalent in many circumstances and systems, and that, just past a crisis, certain characteristic statistical behavior (whose type depends on the type of crisis) occurs. In particular the phenomenon of chaotic transients is investigated. The examples discussed illustrate crises in progressively higher dimension and include the one-dimensional quadratic map, the (two-dimensional) H{\'e}non map, systems of ordinary differential equations in three dimensions and a three-dimensional map. In the case of our study of the three-dimensional map a new route to chaos is proposed which is possible only in invertible maps or flows of dimension at least three or four, respectively. Based on the examples presented the following conjecture is proposed: almost all sudden changes in the size of chaotic attractors and almost all sudden destruction or creations of chaotic attractors and their basins are due to crises.},

Upon varying the parameters of the white shot noise, one can conveniently manipulate the transport direction and the overall nonlinear response behavior. We find that within tailored parameter regimes the response is opposite to the applied average bias F of such white shot noise. This particular transport characteristic thus mimics that of a nonlinear absolute negative mobility (ANM) regime. Moreover, such white shot noise driven ANM is robust with respect to the statistics of the shot noise spikes. Our findings can be checked and corroborated experimentally by the use of a setup that consists of a single resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction device.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Quantum adiabatic processes---that keep constant the populations in the instantaneous eigenbasis of a time-dependent Hamiltonian---are very useful to prepare and manipulate states, but take typically a long time. This is often problematic because decoherence and noise may spoil the desired final state, or because some applications require many repetitions. ``Shortcuts to adiabaticity'' are alternative fast processes which reproduce the same final populations, or even the same final state, as the adiabatic process in a finite, shorter time. Since adiabatic processes are ubiquitous, the shortcuts span a broad range of applications in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, such as fast transport of ions or neutral atoms, internal population control, and state preparation (for nuclear magnetic resonance or quantum information), cold atom expansions and other manipulations, cooling cycles, wavepacket splitting, and many-body state engineering or correlations microscopy. Shortcuts are also relevant to clarify fundamental questions such as a precise quantification of the third principle of thermodynamics and quantum speed limits. We review different theoretical techniques proposed to engineer the shortcuts, the experimental results, and the prospects.},

But a nearby Hamiltonian exists for which the transition amplitudes between any eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian are exactly zero for all values of slowness. The general theory is illustrated by spins driven by changing magnetic fields, and implies that any spin expectation history, including those where the spin never precesses, can be generated by infinitely many driving fields, here displayed explicitly. Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving fields have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reflectionless potentials.},

	N2 = {In the evaluation of quantum annealers, metrics based on ground state success rates have two major drawbacks. First, evaluation requires computation time for both quantum and classical processors that grows exponentially with problem size. This makes evaluation itself computationally prohibitive. Second, results are heavily dependent on the effects of analog noise on the quantum processors, which is an engineering issue that complicates the study of the underlying quantum annealing algorithm. We introduce a novel "time-to-target" metric which avoids these two issues by challenging software solvers to match the results obtained by a quantum annealer in a short amount of time. We evaluate D-Wave's latest quantum annealer, the D-Wave 2X system, on an array of problem classes and find that it performs well on several input classes relative to state of the art software solvers running single-threaded on a CPU.},

	N2 = {One of the main challenges in the field of quantum simulation and computation is to identify ways to certify the correct functioning of a device when a classical efficient simulation is not available. In such a situation one cannot simply classically keep track of the dynamics of the device. In this note, we discuss weak-membership notions of the certification for ground state preparations of frustration-free Hamiltonians based on simple energy measurements of local Hamiltonian terms. These considerations have applications to classically intractable analog quantum simulations: for example, using Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one can realise universal quantum computers. Our certification approach is non-interactive and thus avoids challenges arising from interactive proof systems. Moreover, our certification protocol is applicable to recent results on so-called IQP circuits aiming at the demonstration of quantum supremacy.},

The thermalizing dynamics are modeled by a Davies master equation that arises from a weak local coupling of the system to a large thermal bath. Two temperature regimes are considered. First we clarify how in the low temperature regime, the thermalization time is governed by a generalization of the energy barrier between orthogonal ground states. When no energy barrier is present the Hamiltonian thermalizes in a time that is at most quadratic in the system size. Secondly, we show that above a universal critical temperature, every stabilizer Hamiltonian relaxes to its unique thermal state in a time which scales at most linearly in the size of the system. We provide an explicit lower bound on the critical temperature. Finally, we discuss the implications of these result for the problem of self-correcting quantum memories with stabilizer Hamiltonians.},

Here, we optimize the optical pumping step using shaped laser pulses. We derive two optimization functionals to drive population into those excited state levels that have the largest spontaneous emission rates to the target state. We show that, when using optimal control, laser cooling of molecules works even if the Franck--Condon map governing the transitions is preferential to heating rather than cooling. Our optimization functional is also applicable to the laser cooling of other degrees of freedom provided the cooling cycle consists of coherent excitation and dissipative de-excitation steps whose timescales are separated.},

The feedback is achieved either via mean-field quantum-classical interaction, or, alternatively, via non-disturbing measurements done on an ensemble of identical non-interacting systems. The situation without feedback is governed by the adiabatic theorem: adiabatic energy level populations stay constant, while the adiabatic eigenvectors get a specific phase contribution (Berry phase). However, under feedback the adiabatic theorem does not hold: the adiabatic populations satisfy a closed equation of motion that coincides with the replicator dynamics known by its numerous applications in evolutionary game theory. The feedback generates a new gauge-invariant adiabatic phase, which is free of the constraints on the Berry phase ( e.g. , the new phase is non-zero even for real adiabatic eigenfunctions). In a particular case the adiabatic theorem can still hold, but the new phases are non-trivial.},

	N2 = {Quantum annealing provides a way of solving optimization problems by encoding them as Ising spin models which are implemented using physical qubits. The solution of the optimisation problem then corresponds to the ground state of the system. Quantum tunnelling is harnessed to enable the system to move to the ground state in a potentially highly non-convex energy landscape. A major difficulty in encoding optimization problems in physical quantum annealing devices is the fact that many real world optimisation problems require interactions of higher connectivity as well as multi-body terms beyond the limitations of the physical hardware. In this work we address the question of how to implement multi-body interactions using hardware which natively only provides two-body interactions. The main result is an efficient circuit design of such multi-body terms using superconducting flux qubits. It is then shown how this circuit can be used as a unit cell of a scalable architecture by applying it to a recently proposed embedding technique for constructing an architecture of logical qubits with arbitrary connectivity using physical qubits which have nearest-neighbour four-body interactions.},

	Abstract = {It is control that turns scientific knowledge into useful technology: in physics and engineering it provides a systematic way for driving a dynamical system from a given initial state into a desired target state with minimized expenditure of energy and resources. As one of the cornerstones for enabling quantum technologies, optimal quantum control keeps evolving and expanding into areas as diverse as quantum-enhanced sensing, manipulation of single spins, photons, or atoms, optical spectroscopy, photochemistry, magnetic resonance (spectroscopy as well as medical imaging), quantum information processing and quantum simulation. In this communication, state-of-the-art quantum control techniques are reviewed and put into perspective by a consortium of experts in optimal control theory and applications to spectroscopy, imaging, as well as quantum dynamics of closed and open systems. We address key challenges and sketch a roadmap for future developments.},

Using the generalised Trotter formula and replica methods, the free energy for the system with quenched random bond interactions is evaluated using the static approximation.

The authors also show that a replica-symmetric spin glass phase is stable in a certain region of the temperature-field phase diagram.

	N2 = {The need for Hamiltonians with many-body interactions arises in various applications of quantum computing. However, interactions beyond two-body are difficult to realize experimentally. Perturbative gadgets were introduced to obtain arbitrary many-body effective interactions using Hamiltonians with two-body interactions only. Although valid for arbitrary $k$-body interactions, their use is limited to small $k$ because the strength of interaction is $k$'th order in perturbation theory. In this paper we develop a nonperturbative technique for obtaining effective $k$-body interactions using Hamiltonians consisting of at most $l$-body interactions with $l<k$. This technique works best for Hamiltonians with a few interactions with very large $k$ and can be used together with perturbative gadgets to embed Hamiltonians of considerable complexity in proper subspaces of two-local Hamiltonians. We describe how our technique can be implemented in a hybrid (gate-based and adiabatic) as well as solely adiabatic quantum computing scheme.},

A semiconductor spin qubit may be controlled without the use of magnetic fields by using three electrons in three tunnel-coupled quantum dots. Triple dots have previously been implemented in GaAs, but this material suffers from intrinsic nuclear magnetic noise. Reduction of this noise is possible by fabricating devices using isotopically purified silicon. We demonstrate universal coherent control of a triple-quantum-dot qubit implemented in an isotopically enhanced Si/SiGe heterostructure. Composite pulses are used to implement spin-echo type sequences, and differential charge sensing enables single-shot state readout. These experiments demonstrate sufficient control with sufficiently low noise to enable the long pulse sequences required for exchange-only two-qubit logic and randomized benchmarking.},

(p. 583) study a system of 16 trapped ions, using the Coulomb interactions between the ions to simulate exchange interactions present in magnetic systems. The measured spin correlations provide a window into the behavior of the system, as the effective magnetic field and the range of the interactions are tuned. Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the emergent complexity of many-body systems. For instance, frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses, and spin ices, whose ground states can be massively degenerate and carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. Here, we engineer frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions between spins stored in a crystal of up to 16 trapped 171Yb+ atoms. We control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their coherent dynamics. This prototypical quantum simulation points the way toward a new probe of frustrated quantum magnetism and perhaps the design of new quantum materials.},

Here, we implement digitized adiabatic quantum computing, combining the generality of the adiabatic algorithm with the universality of the digital approach, using a superconducting circuit with nine qubits. We probe the adiabatic evolutions, and quantify the success of the algorithm for random spin problems. We find that the system can approximate the solutions to both frustrated Ising problems and problems with more complex interactions, with a performance that is comparable. The presented approach is compatible with small-scale systems as well as future error-corrected quantum computers.},

	N2 = {Tunneling is often claimed to be the key mechanism underlying possible speedups in quantum optimization via quantum annealing (QA), especially for problems featuring a cost function with tall and thin barriers. We present and analyze several counterexamples from the class of perturbed Hamming-weight optimization problems with qubit permutation symmetry. We first show that, for these problems, the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible should be understood not in terms of the cost function but rather the semi-classical potential arising from the spin-coherent path integral formalism. We then provide an example where the shape of the barrier in the final cost function is short and wide, which might suggest no quantum advantage for QA, yet where tunneling renders QA superior to simulated annealing in the adiabatic regime. However, the adiabatic dynamics turn out not be optimal. Instead, an evolution involving a sequence of diabatic transitions through many avoided level-crossings, involving no tunneling, is optimal and outperforms adiabatic QA. We show that this phenomenon of speedup by diabatic transitions is not unique to this example, and we provide an example where it provides an exponential speedup over adiabatic QA. In yet another twist, we show that a classical algorithm, spin vector dynamics, is at least as efficient as diabatic QA. Finally, in a different example with a convex cost function, the diabatic transitions result in a speedup relative to both adiabatic QA with tunneling and classical spin vector dynamics.},

We present insight into how results may be improved using suitable software enhancements, and why current quantum annealing technology limits the size of problem that can be successfully solved today.

	Abstract = {Quantum annealing is a promising approach for solving optimization problems, but like all other quantum information processing methods, it requires error correction to ensure scalability. In this work, we experimentally compare two quantum annealing correction (QAC) codes in the setting of antiferromagnetic chains, using two different quantum annealing processors. The lower-temperature processor gives rise to higher success probabilities. The two codes differ in a number of interesting and important ways, but both require four physical qubits per encoded qubit. We find significant performance differences, which we explain in terms of the effective energy boost provided by the respective redundantly encoded logical operators of the two codes. The code with the higher energy boost results in improved performance, at the expense of a lower-degree encoded graph. Therefore, we find that there exists an important trade-off between encoded connectivity and performance for quantum annealing correction codes.},

	Abstract = {The probability for a sequence of information symbols to have been sent, when the transmission channel's output is known, is simply related to a spin glass Hamiltonian. The ground state of this Hamiltonian provides the most probable input sequence, given the channel's output. Furthermore, the local magnetization at a certain value of the temperature is related to the most probable value of the corresponding information symbol, i.e. finite-temperature decoding provides the sequence of the most probable symbols, which, in general, is different from the most probable sequence.},

	Abstract = {Quantum annealers are physical devices that aim at solving NP-complete optimization problems by exploiting quantum mechanics. The basic principle of quantum annealing is to encode the optimization problem in Ising interactions between quantum bits (qubits). A fundamental challenge in building a fully programmable quantum annealer is the competing requirements of full controllable all-to-all connectivity and the quasi-locality of the interactions between physical qubits. We present a scalable architecture with full connectivity, which can be implemented with local interactions only. The input of the optimization problem is encoded in local fields acting on an extended set of physical qubits. The output is{\textemdash}in the spirit of topological quantum memories{\textemdash}redundantly encoded in the physical qubits, resulting in an intrinsic fault tolerance. Our model can be understood as a lattice gauge theory, where long-range interactions are mediated by gauge constraints. The architecture can be realized on various platforms with local controllability, including superconducting qubits, NV-centers, quantum dots, and atomic systems.},

	Abstract = {Quantum tunnelling is a phenomenon in which a quantum state traverses energy barriers higher than the energy of the state itself. Quantum tunnelling has been hypothesized as an advantageous physical resource for optimization in quantum annealing. However, computational multiqubit tunnelling has not yet been observed, and a theory of co-tunnelling under high- and low-frequency noises is lacking. Here we show that 8-qubit tunnelling plays a computational role in a currently available programmable quantum annealer. We devise a probe for tunnelling, a computational primitive where classical paths are trapped in a false minimum. In support of the design of quantum annealers we develop a nonperturbative theory of open quantum dynamics under realistic noise characteristics. This theory accurately predicts the rate of many-body dissipative quantum tunnelling subject to the polaron effect. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that quantum tunnelling outperforms thermal hopping along classical paths for problems with up to 200 qubits containing the computational primitive.},

	N2 = {In Deep Learning, a well-known approach for training a Deep Neural Network starts by training a generative Deep Belief Network model, typically using Contrastive Divergence (CD), then fine-tuning the weights using backpropagation or other discriminative techniques. However, the generative training can be time-consuming due to the slow mixing of Gibbs sampling. We investigated an alternative approach that estimates model expectations of Restricted Boltzmann Machines using samples from a D-Wave quantum annealing machine. We tested this method on a coarse-grained version of the MNIST data set. In our tests we found that the quantum sampling-based training approach achieves comparable or better accuracy with significantly fewer iterations of generative training than conventional CD-based training. Further investigation is needed to determine whether similar improvements can be achieved for other data sets, and to what extent these improvements can be attributed to quantum effects.},

	N2 = {A major goal for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is to reduce the overhead needed for error correction. One approach is to use block codes that encode multiple qubits, which can achieve significantly higher rates for the same code distance than single-qubit code blocks or topological codes. We present a scheme for universal quantum computation using multi-qubit Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) block codes, where codes admitting different transversal gates are used to achieve universality, and logical teleportation is used to move qubits between code blocks. All circuits for both computation and error correction are transversal. We also argue that single shot fault-tolerant error correction can be done in Steane syndrome extraction. Then, we present estimates of information lifetime for a few possible codes, which suggests that highly nontrivial quantum computations can be achieved at reasonable error rates, using codes that require significantly less than 100 physical qubits per logical qubit.},

We derive the exact probability distribution of A seen as a random variable when | ψ 〉 varies over the set of all pure states equipped with the Haar-induced measure. To illustrate our results we compare the exact predictions for few concrete examples with the concentration bounds obtained using Levyʼs lemma. We also comment on the relevance of the central limit theorem and finally draw some results on an alternative statistical mechanics based on the uniform measure on the energy shell.},

@article{Abasto:2012ly,
	Abstract = {Symmetric couplings among aggregates of n chromophores increase the transfer rate of excitons by a factor n2, a quantum-mechanical phenomenon called `supertransfer'. In this work, we demonstrate how supertransfer effects induced by geometrical symmetries can enhance the exciton diffusion length by a factor n along cylindrically symmetric structures, consisting of arrays of rings of chromophores, and along spiral arrays. We analyse both closed-system dynamics and open quantum dynamics, modelled by combining a random bosonic bath with static disorder. In the closed-system case, we use the symmetries of the system within a short-time approximation to obtain a closed analytical expression for the diffusion length that explicitly reveals the supertransfer contribution. When subject to disorder, we show that supertransfer can enhance excitonic diffusion lengths for small disorders and characterize the crossover from coherent to incoherent motion. Owing to the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the model, disorder ultimately localizes the excitons, diminishing but not destroying the effects of supertransfer. When dephasing effects are included, we study the scaling of diffusion with both time and number of chromophores and observe that the transition from a coherent, ballistic regime to an incoherent, random-walk regime occurs at the same point as the change from supertransfer to classical scaling.},

	N2 = {Topological color codes are among the stabilizer codes with remarkable properties from the quantum information perspective. In this paper, we construct a lattice, the so-called ruby lattice, with coordination number 4 governed by a two-body Hamiltonian. In a particular regime of coupling constants, in a strong coupling limit, degenerate perturbation theory implies that the low-energy spectrum of the model can be described by a many-body effective Hamiltonian, which encodes the color code as its ground state subspace. Ground state subspace corresponds to a vortex-free sector. The gauge symmetry Z 2 × Z 2 of the color code could already be realized by identifying three distinct plaquette operators on the ruby lattice. All plaquette operators commute with each other and with the Hamiltonian being integrals of motion. Plaquettes are extended to closed strings or string-net structures. Non-contractible closed strings winding the space commute with Hamiltonian but not always with each other. This gives rise to exact topological degeneracy of the model. A connection to 2-colexes can be established via the coloring of the strings. We discuss it at the non-perturbative level. The particular structure of the two-body Hamiltonian provides a fruitful interpretation in terms of mapping onto bosons coupled to effective spins. We show that high-energy excitations of the model have fermionic statistics. They form three families of high-energy excitations each of one color. Furthermore, we show that they belong to a particular family of topological charges. The emergence of invisible charges is related to the string-net structure of the model. The emerging fermions are coupled to nontrivial gauge fields. We show that for particular 2-colexes, the fermions can see the background fluxes in the ground state. Also, we use the Jordan--Wigner transformation in order to test the integrability of the model via introducing Majorana fermions. The four-valent structure of the lattice prevents the fermionized Hamiltonian from being reduced to a quadratic form owing to interacting gauge fields. We also propose another construction for the two-body Hamiltonian based on the connection between color codes and cluster states. The corresponding two-body Hamiltonian encodes a cluster state defined on a bipartite lattice as its low-energy spectrum, and subsequent selective measurements give rise to the color code model. We discuss this latter approach along with the construction based on the ruby lattice.},

In this work, expanding on our earlier paper (Paz-Silva et al 2012 Phys. Rev. Lett. 108 080501), we evaluate the applicability of the quantum Zeno effect as one such method. Using the algebraic structure of stabilizer quantum error correction codes as a unifying framework, two open-loop protocols are described which involve frequent non-projective (i.e. weak) measurement of either the full stabilizer group or a minimal generating set thereof. The effectiveness of the protocols is measured by the distance between the final state under the protocol and the final state of an idealized evolution in which system and environment do not interact. Rigorous bounds on this metric are derived which demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, a Zeno effect may be realized with arbitrarily weak measurements, and that this effect can protect an arbitrary, unknown encoded state against the environment arbitrarily well.},

	Abstract = {It is generally impossible to probe a quantum system without disturbing it. However, it is possible to exploit the back action of quantum measurements and strong couplings to tailor and protect the coherent evolution of a quantum system. This is a profound and counterintuitive phenomenon known as quantum Zeno dynamics. Here we demonstrate quantum Zeno dynamics with a rubidium Bose--Einstein condensate in a five-level Hilbert space. We harness measurements and strong couplings to dynamically disconnect different groups of quantum states and constrain the atoms to coherently evolve inside a two-level subregion. In parallel to the foundational importance due to the realization of a dynamical superselection rule and the theory of quantum measurements, this is an important step forward in protecting and controlling quantum dynamics and, broadly speaking, quantum information processing.},

	Abstract = {The ability of quantum systems to host exponentially complex dynamics has the potential to revolutionize science and technology. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to developing of protocols for computation, communication and metrology, which exploit this scaling, despite formidable technical difficulties. Here we show that the mere frequent observation of a small part of a quantum system can turn its dynamics from a very simple one into an exponentially complex one, capable of universal quantum computation. After discussing examples, we go on to show that this effect is generally to be expected: almost any quantum dynamics becomes universal once `observed'as outlined above. Conversely, we show that any complex quantum dynamics can be `purified'into a simpler one in larger dimensions. We conclude by demonstrating that even local noise can lead to an exponentially complex dynamics.},

Here, we provide an almost complete characterization of the class of strictly purity-decreasing quantum dynamical semigroups. We show that in the case of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, a dynamical semigroup is strictly purity-decreasing if and only if it is unital, while in the infinite dimensional case, unitality is only sufficient.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides a review of both Rent's rule and the placement models derived from it. It is proposed that the power-law form of Rent's rule, which predicts the number of terminals required by a group of gates for communication with the rest of the circuit, is a consequence of a statistically homogeneous circuit topology and gate placement. The term "homogeneous" is used to imply that quantities such as the average wire length per gate and the average number of terminals per gate are independent of the position within the circuit. Rent's rule is used to derive a variety of net length distribution models and the approach adopted in this paper is to factor the distribution function into the product of an occupancy probability distribution and a function which represents the number of valid net placement sites. This approach places diverse placement models under a common framework and allows the errors introduced by the modeling process to be isolated and evaluated. Models for both planar and hierarchical gate placement are presented.},

Our theory accounts for uncertainties in the noise channel, against which our QEC procedures are robust. We demonstrate, via numerical examples, that our optimized QEC procedures always achieve a higher channel fidelity than the standard error correction method, which is agnostic about the specifics of the channel. This demonstrates the importance of channel characterization before QEC procedures are applied. Our main novel finding is that in the setting of a known noise channel the recovery ancillas are redundant for optimized quantum error correction. We show this using a general rank minimization heuristic and supporting numerical calculations. Therefore, one can further improve the fidelity by utilizing all the available ancillas in the encoding block.},

	N2 = {Compressed sensing (CS) is a technique to faithfully estimate an unknown signal from relatively few data points when the measurement samples satisfy a restricted isometry property (RIP). Recently, this technique has been ported to quantum information science to perform tomography with a substantially reduced number of measurement settings. In this work we show that the constraint that a physical density matrix is positive semidefinite provides a rigorous connection between the RIP and the informational completeness of a POVM used for state tomography. This enables us to construct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise using tools provided by the CS methodology. The exact recovery no longer hinges on a particular convex optimization program; solving any optimization, constrained to the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, effectively results in a CS estimation of the state. From a practical point of view, we can therefore employ fast algorithms developed to handle large dimensional matrices for efficient tomography of quantum states of a large dimensional Hilbert space.},

@article{HorsmanNJP2012,
	Abstract = {In recent years, surface codes have become a leading method for quantum error correction in theoretical large-scale computational and communications architecture designs. Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and their natural two-dimensional nearest-neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an obvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems. While fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants, two of which are the planar- and defect-based codes. Planar codes require fewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are restricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between encoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the inherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique enabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations, maintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique comprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform universal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing the need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the overall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further reduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how lattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct (and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT between two distance-3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half of that required in any other known construction in 2D.},

Specifically we look at symmetric cost functions defined over n bits with a single potential barrier that a successful optimization algorithm will have to tunnel through. The height and width of this barrier depend on n, and by tuning these dependencies, we can make the optimization algorithm succeed or fail in polynomial time. In this article we compare the strength of quantum adiabatic tunneling with that of path-integral quantum Monte Carlo methods. We find numerical evidence that quantum Monte Carlo algorithms will succeed in the same regimes where quantum adiabatic optimization succeeds.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we explore noise-tolerant learning of classifiers. We formulate the problem as follows. We assume that there is an <b>unobservable</b> training set that is noise free. The actual training set given to the learning algorithm is obtained from this ideal data set by corrupting the class label of each example. The probability that the class label of an example is corrupted is a function of the feature vector of the example. This would account for most kinds of noisy data one encounters in practice. We say that a learning method is noise tolerant if the classifiers learnt with noise-free data and with noisy data, both have the same classification accuracy on the noise-free data. In this paper, we analyze the noise-tolerance properties of risk minimization (under different loss functions). We show that risk minimization under 0-1 loss function has impressive noise-tolerance properties and that under squared error loss is tolerant only to uniform noise; risk minimization under other loss functions is not noise tolerant. We conclude this paper with some discussion on the implications of these theoretical results.},

	Abstract = {We provide a rigorous proof that Jeffreys' prior asymptotically maximizes Shannon's mutual information between a sample of size n and the parameter. This was conjectured by Bernardo (1979) and, despite the absence of a proof, forms the basis of the reference prior method in Bayesian statistical analysis. Our proof rests on an examination of large sample decision theoretic properties associated with the relative entropy or the Kullback--Leibler distance between probability density functions for independent and identically distributed random variables. For smooth finite-dimensional parametric families we derive an asymptotic expression for the minimax risk and for the related maximin risk. As a result, we show that, among continuous positive priors, Jeffreys' prior uniquely achieves the asymptotic maximin value. In the discrete parameter case we show that, asymptotically, the Bayes risk reduces to the entropy of the prior so that the reference prior is seen to be the maximum entropy prior. We identify the physical significance of the risks by giving two information-theoretic interpretations in terms of probabilistic coding.},

	N2 = {With the advent of large-scale quantum annealing devices, several challenges have emerged. For example, it has been shown that the performance of a device can be significantly affected by several degrees of freedom when programming the device; a common example being gauge selection. To date, no experimentally-tested strategy exists to select the best programming specifications. We developed a score function that can be calculated from a number of readouts much smaller than the number of readouts required to find the desired solution. We show how this performance estimator can be used to guide, for example, the selection of the optimal gauges out of a pool of random gauge candidates and how to select the values of parameters for which we have no a priori knowledge of the optimal value. For the latter, we illustrate the concept by applying the score function to set the strength of the parameter intended to enforce the embedding of the logical graph into the hardware architecture, a challenge frequently encountered in the implementation of real-world problem instances. Since the harder the problem instances, the more useful the strategies proposed in this work are, we expect the programming strategies proposed to significantly reduce the time of future benchmark studies and in help finding the solution of hard-to-solve real-world applications implemented in the next generation of quantum annealing devices.},

	N2 = {We derive a microscopic model for dissipative dynamics in a system of qubits interacting with an Ohmic bath that generalises the dissipative model of Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert to the case of general anisotropic couplings to a thermal bath. Obtained from the Keldysh path integral formalism, it gives the classical (zero entanglement) limit of a system's dynamics. The fluctuation dissipation relation enforces a close relationship between the thermal fluctuations and dissipative forcing terms of these dynamical equations. We use a representation that highlights the action of dissipation in confining the system to a reduced phase space. This model applies to a system of superconducting flux qubits whose coupling to the environment is necessarily anisotropic. We study the model in the context of the D-Wave computing device and show that the form of environmental coupling in this case produces dynamics that are closely related to several models proposed on phenomenological grounds.},

	Abstract = {Quantum information can be encoded in the set of steady states (SSS) of a driven-dissipative system. Nonsteady states are separated by a large dissipative gap that adiabatically decouples them while the dynamics inside the SSS is governed by an effective, dissipation-projected, Hamiltonian. The latter results from the interplay between a weak driving and the fast relaxation process that continuously projects the system back to the SSS. This amounts to a different type of environment-induced quantum Zeno effect. We prove that the dissipation-projected dynamics is of geometric nature and that it is robust against different types of Hamiltonian and dissipative perturbations. Remarkably, in some cases an effective unitary dynamics can emerge out of purely dissipative interactions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate quantum annealing (QA) with antiferromagnetic transverse interactions for the generalized Hopfield model with k -body interactions. The goal is to study the effectiveness of antiferromagnetic interactions, which were shown to help us avoid problematic first-order quantum phase transitions in pure ferromagnetic systems, in random systems. We estimate the efficiency of QA by analyzing phase diagrams for two cases where the number of embedded patterns is finite or extensively large. The phase diagrams of the model with finite patterns show that there exist annealing paths that avoid first-order transitions at least for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/48/33/335301/jpa517153ieqn1.gif] {$5\leqslant k\leqslant 21$} . The same is true for the extensive case with k = 4 and 5. In contrast, it is impossible to avoid first-order transitions for the case of finite patterns with k = 3 and the case of extensive number of patterns with k = 2 and 3. The spin-glass phase hampers the QA process in the case of k = 2 and extensive patterns. These results indicate that QA with antiferromagnetic transverse interactions is efficient also for certain random spin systems.},

	Abstract = {The ability to detect and deal with errors when manipulating quantum systems is a fundamental requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Unlike classical bits that are subject to only digital bit-flip errors, quantum bits are susceptible to a much larger spectrum of errors, for which any complete quantum error-correcting code must account. Whilst classical bit-flip detection can be realized via a linear array of qubits, a general fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting code requires extending into a higher-dimensional lattice. Here we present a quantum error detection protocol on a two-by-two planar lattice of superconducting qubits. The protocol detects an arbitrary quantum error on an encoded two-qubit entangled state via quantum non-demolition parity measurements on another pair of error syndrome qubits. This result represents a building block towards larger lattices amenable to fault-tolerant quantum error correction architectures such as the surface code.},

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed <img src="/images/tex/1046.gif" alt="j"> . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed <img src="/images/tex/1046.gif" alt="j"> . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For <img src="/images/tex/6648.gif" alt="j > 3"> and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound.},

It teaches the use of the powerful nonperturbative techniques that have become available in the last decades to discuss such topics as mixed valence systems, Kondo systems, heavy electrons, high-temperature copper oxide superconductors, the quantum Hall effect, and low-dimensional isotropic magnets. Mathematical derivations are self contained. Appendices provide standard many-body tools including second quantization, Grassmann variables, generating functionals, linear response, correlation functions, Fermi and Bose coherent-states path integrals, Matsubara representation, and the method of steepest descents. There are guided bibliographies and exercises at the end of each chapter.},

We consider an open system quantum annealing algorithm optimized for a realistic analog quantum device which takes advantage of noise-induced thermalization and relies on incoherent quantum tunneling at finite temperature. We analyze the performance of this algorithm considering a p-spin model which allows for a mean field quasicalssical solution and at the same time demonstrates the 1st order phase transition and exponential degeneracy of states. We demonstrate that finite temperature effects introduced by the noise are particularly important for the dynamics in presence of the exponential degeneracy of metastable states. We determine the optimal regime of the open system quantum annealing algorithm for this model and find that it can outperform simulated annealing in a range of parameters.},

We may assume without loss of generality that $\|S^\alpha\|=1$ by redefining $\|B_i^\alpha\|$ if necessary. The strength of the interaction can be characterized by $J= \max_\alpha \sum_i \|B_i^\alpha\|$, and we assume that $J$ converges in the limit $N_\B\to\infty$. Let $b=\max_i B_i^0$, and we assume that $b$ is finite. Reservoir operators acting on different reservoir DOFs commute: $[B_i^\alpha,B_j^{\alpha'}]=0$ $\forall i\neq j$. The only nonvanishing commutators are $[B_i^\alpha,B_i^{\alpha'}]$ $\forall \alpha \neq \alpha'$ (including $0$). We can now bound the commutator: $\|[H_\inter ,H_\B]\| = \| \sum_i [H_{\inter,i},B_i^0]\| \leq \sum_{\alpha} \|S^\alpha\| \sum_i 2\| B_i^\alpha\| \|B_i^0\| \leq 2J b N_\sys $. The important point is that $N_\B$, which can in principle diverge, does not appear in this bound.}}}

	Abstract = {The Schrieffer--Wolff (SW) method is a version of degenerate perturbation theory in which the low-energy effective Hamiltonian H eff is obtained from the exact Hamiltonian by a unitary transformation decoupling the low-energy and high-energy subspaces. We give a self-contained summary of the \{SW\} method with a focus on rigorous results. We begin with an exact definition of the \{SW\} transformation in terms of the so-called direct rotation between linear subspaces. From this we obtain elementary proofs of several important properties of H eff such as the linked cluster theorem. We then study the perturbative version of the \{SW\} transformation obtained from a Taylor series representation of the direct rotation. Our perturbative approach provides a systematic diagram technique for computing high-order corrections to H eff . We then specialize the \{SW\} method to quantum spin lattices with short-range interactions. We establish unitary equivalence between effective low-energy Hamiltonians obtained using two different versions of the \{SW\} method studied in the literature. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the precision up to which the ground state energy of the n th-order effective Hamiltonian approximates the exact ground state energy. },

In this case, in the $\Delta E \rightarrow \infty$ limit the evolution of states inside $\mc{C}$ is described by the Hamiltonian $H_\sys+K_\sys$. This modification of the system Hamiltonian can be useful, e.g., in the context of quantum computation driven by dissipation \cite{Zanardi:2014fr}. We can use the argument leading to the bound \eqref{main_bound_open} to find how close the actual evolution is to the ideal evolution generated by $H_\sys+K_\sys$. Let $\tilde{\rho}_\id(t)=e^{-i t (H_\sys+K_\sys)} \rho(0) e^{i t (H_\sys+K_\sys)}$. Then, it turns out that for any state $\rho(0) \in \mc{C}$: \begin{align*} &\sqrt{ 1-F(\tilde{\rho}_\id(t),\rho(t) )}\le \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\frac{\|H_\inter \|}{\ \Delta E}\right.\\ &\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \left. + t \left(\frac{\|[H_\inter ,H_\B]\|}{\Delta E-2 \|H_\inter \|}+ \frac{\|H_\inter \|{(\delta E+\|H_\inter \|)}}{{\Delta E}}\right) \right]\ . \end{align*} We note that the term $\frac{\|[H_\inter ,H_\B]\|}{\Delta E-2 \|H_\inter \|}$ does not appear in the Markovian analysis of Ref.~\cite{Zanardi:2014fr}.}}}

We show that a violation of a Bell inequality can formally be expressed as a witness for entanglement. We also show how the criterion for separability and the existence of a description of the state by a local hidden variable theory, become equivalent when we restrict the set of local hidden variable theories to the domain of quantum mechanics. This analysis sheds light on the essential difference between the two criteria.},

	N2 = {We argue that a quantum annealer at very long annealing times is likely to experience a quasistatic evolution, returning a final population that is close to a Boltzmann distribution of the Hamiltonian at a single (freeze-out) point during the annealing. Such a system is expected to correlate well with a proper quantum Monte Carlo simulation. It may also correlate with simulated annealing if at the freeze-out point the quantum energy eigenvalues are close to the classical ones. These correlations are just signatures of equilibration and do not mean that the evolution of the quantum annealer is classical or can be simulated by quantum Monte Carlo. The computation time extracted from such a distribution reflects the equilibrium behavior and therefore provides no information about the underlying quantum dynamics. This makes the search for quantum speedup in suboptimal quantum annealers problematic. We use an open quantum master equation with realistic parameters to illustrate quasistatic evolution in a 16 qubit quantum annealer and discuss its implication for quantum speedup.},

In a finite two-dimensional lattice these problems can be solved by algorithms that require a number of steps bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the lattice. In contrast to this fact, the same problems are shown to belong to the class of NP-hard problems, both in the two-dimensional case within a magnetic field, and in the three-dimensional case. NP-hardness of a problem suggests that it is very unlikely that a polynomial algorithm could exist to solve it.},

@article{Hen2014,
	Abstract = {We consider a family of unstructured optimization problems, for which we propose a method for constructing analogue, continuous-time (not necessarily adiabatic) quantum algorithms that are faster than their classical counterparts. In this family of problems, which we refer to as `scrambled input' problems, one has to find a minimum-cost configuration of a given integer-valued n -bit black-box function whose input values have been scrambled in some unknown way. Special cases within this set of problems are Grover's search problem of finding a marked item in an unstructured database, certain random energy models, and the functions of the Deutsch--Josza problem. We consider a couple of examples in detail. In the first, we provide an O (1) deterministic analogue quantum algorithm to solve the seminal problem of Deutsch and Josza, in which one has to determine whether an n -bit boolean function is constant (gives 0 on all inputs or 1 on all inputs) or balanced (returns 0 on half the input states and 1 on the other half). We also study one variant of the random energy model, and show that, as one might expect, its minimum energy configuration can be found quadratically faster with a quantum adiabatic algorithm than with classical algorithms.},

	Abstract = {The theory of quantum dynamical semigroups within the mathematically rigorous framework of completely positive dynamical maps is reviewed. First, the axiomatic approach which deals with phenomenological constructions and general mathematical structures is discussed. Then basic derivation schemes of the constructive approach including singular coupling, weak coupling and low density limits are presented in their higly simplified versions. Two-level system coupled to a heat bath, damped harmonic oscillator, models of decoherence, quantum Brownian particle and Bloch-Boltzmann equations are used as illustrations of the general theory. Physical and mathematical limitations of the quantum open system theory, the validity of Markovian approximation and alternative approaches are discussed also.},

It is shown that, below a critical temperature, certain topological qubit observables X and Z possess relaxation times exponentially long in the size of the system. Their construction involves polynomial in system's size algorithm which uses as an input the results of measurements performed on all individual spins. We also discuss the drawbacks of such candidate for quantum memory and mention the implications of the stability of qubit for statistical mechanics.},

	Abstract = {The singularities of the stratification of the space of the Hermitian matrices according to the multiplicities of the eigenvalues are described as an informal complexification of the previous study of the space of the real symmetric matrices. The degeneration of the spectral sequence associated to this stratification provides some strange combinatorial identities. The eigenvector bundles over the manifold of the Hermitian matrices with simple spectra are equiped with the natural connections, describing also the adiabatic approximation to the oscillations of the linear systems defined by the slowly varying skew Hermitian matrices. The curvature of this connection is singular at the codimension 3 variety of the Hermitian matrices having multiple eigenvalues. The resulting jumps of the integrals of the curvature form at the crossings of this variety by the moving surface of integration are responsible for the quantum Hall effect.},

	Abstract = {A general framework for analyzing the recently discovered phase transitions in the steady state of dissipation-driven open quantum systems is still lacking. To fill this gap, we extend the so-called fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions to open systems whose steady state is a Gaussian fermionic state. We endow the manifold of correlation matrices of steady states with a metric tensor g measuring the distinguishability distance between solutions corresponding to a different set of control parameters. The phase diagram can then be mapped out in terms of the scaling behavior of g and connections with the Liouvillean gap and the model correlation functions unveiled. We argue that the fidelity approach, thanks to its differential-geometric and information-theoretic nature, provides insights into dissipative quantum critical phenomena as well as a general and powerful strategy to explore them.},

Accordingly, the review is divided into two parts. The first part revolves around a quantum version of the Kibble--Zurek mechanism including also phenomena that go beyond this simple paradigm. What they have in common is that excitation of a gapless many-body system scales with a power of the driving rate. The second part attempts a systematic presentation of recent results and conjectures on apparent relaxation of a pure state of an isolated quantum many-body system after its excitation by a sudden quench. This research is motivated in part by recent experimental developments in the physics of ultracold atoms with potential applications in the adiabatic quantum state preparation and quantum computation.},

The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

	Abstract = {A quantum system will stay near its instantaneous ground state if the Hamiltonian that governs its evolution varies slowly enough. This quantum adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum computing. We tested one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated hard instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we could simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well, providing evidence that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems.},

	Abstract = {In the conventional quantum mechanics (i.e., Hermitian quantum mechanics) the adiabatic theorem for systems subjected to time-periodic fields holds only for bound systems and not for open ones (where ionization and dissociation take place) [D. W. Hone, R. Ketzmerik, and W. Kohn, Phys. Rev. A 56, 4045 (1997)]. Here with the help of the (t,t′) formalism combined with the complex scaling method we derive an adiabatic theorem for open systems and provide an analytical criterion for the validity of the adiabatic limit. The use of the complex scaling transformation plays a key role in our derivation. As a numerical example we apply the adiabatic theorem we derived to a one-dimensional model Hamiltonian of Xe atom which interacts with strong, monochromatic sine-square laser pulses. We show that the generation of odd-order harmonics and the absence of hyper-Raman lines, even when the pulses are extremely short, can be explained with the help of the adiabatic theorem we derived.},

@article{joye_general_2007,
	Abstract = {We consider the adiabatic regime of two parameters evolution semigroups generated by linear operators that are analytic in time and satisfy the following gap condition for all times: the spectrum of the generator consists in finitely many isolated eigenvalues of finite algebraic multiplicity, away from the rest of the spectrum. The restriction of the generator to the spectral subspace corresponding to the distinguished eigenvalues is not assumed to be diagonalizable. The presence of eigenilpotents in the spectral decomposition of the generator typically leads to solutions which grow exponentially fast in some inverse power of the adiabaticity parameter, even for real spectrum. In turn, this forbids the evolution to follow all instantaneous eigenprojectors of the generator in the adiabatic limit. Making use of superadiabatic renormalization, we construct a different set of time-dependent projectors, close to the instantaneous eigenprojectors of the generator in the adiabatic limit, and an approximation of the evolution semigroup which intertwines exactly between the values of these projectors at the initial and final times. Hence, the evolution semigroup follows the constructed set of projectors in the adiabatic regime, modulo error terms we control.},

	Abstract = {Universal quantum computation on decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems (DFSs) is examined with particular emphasis on using only physically relevant interactions. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of decoherence-free (noiseless) subsystems in the Markovian regime is derived here for the first time. A stabilizer formalism for DFSs is then developed which allows for the explicit understanding of these in their dual role as quantum error correcting codes. Conditions for the existence of Hamiltonians whose induced evolution always preserves a DFS are derived within this stabilizer formalism. Two possible collective decoherence mechanisms arising from permutation symmetries of the system-bath coupling are examined within this framework. It is shown that in both cases universal quantum computation which always preserves the DFS (natural fault-tolerant computation) can be performed using only two-body interactions. This is in marked contrast to standard error correcting codes, where all known constructions using one- or two-body interactions must leave the code space during the on-time of the fault-tolerant gates. A further consequence of our universality construction is that a single exchange Hamiltonian can be used to perform universal quantum computation on an encoded space whose asymptotic coding efficiency is unity. The exchange Hamiltonian, which is naturally present in many quantum systems, is thus asymptotically universal.},

Furthermore, the relaxation time of this dissipative process is independent of the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the general formalism by considering arbitrary matrix-product states or projected entangled pair states. In particular, we show that the ground state of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model can be prepared employing a quasi-local dissipative process.},

	Abstract = {We present explicit kinetic equations for quantum transport through a general molecular quantum-dot, accounting for all contributions up to 4th order perturbation theory in the tunneling Hamiltonian and the complete molecular density matrix. Such a full treatment describes not only sequential, cotunneling and pair tunneling, but also contains terms contributing to renormalization of the molecular resonances as well as their broadening. Due to the latter all terms in the perturbation expansion are automatically well-defined for any set of system parameters, no divergences occur and no by-hand regularization is required. Additionally we show that, in contrast to 2nd order perturbation theory, in 4th order it is essential to account for quantum coherence between non-degenerate states, entering the theory through the non-diagonal elements of the density matrix. As a first application, we study a single-molecule transistor coupled to a localized vibrational mode (Anderson-Holstein model). We find that cotunneling-assisted sequential tunneling processes involving the vibration give rise to current peaks i.e. negative differential conductance in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Such peaks occur in the cross-over to strong electron-vibration coupling, where inelastic cotunneling competes with Franck-Condon suppressed sequential tunneling, and thereby indicate the strength of the electron-vibration coupling. The peaks depend sensitively on the coupling to a dissipative bath, thus providing also an experimental probe of the Q-factor of the vibrational motion.},

	Abstract = {The quantitative adiabatic condition (QAC), or quantitative condition, is a convenient (a priori) tool for estimating the adiabaticity of quantum evolutions. However, the range of the applicability of QAC is not well understood. It has been shown that QAC can become insufficient for guaranteeing the validity of the adiabatic approximation, but under what conditions the QAC would become necessary has become controversial. Furthermore, it is believed that the inability for the QAC to reveal quantum adiabaticity is due to induced resonant transitions. However, it is not clear how to quantify these transitions in general. Here we present a progress to this problem by finding an exact relation that can reveal how transition amplitudes are related to QAC directly. As a posteriori condition for quantum adiabaticity, our result is universally applicable to any (nondegenerate) quantum system and gives a clear picture on how QAC could become insufficient or unnecessary for the adiabatic approximation, which is a problem that has gained considerable interest in the literature in recent years.},

	Abstract = {We prove that for any finite set of generalized valence bond solid (GVBS) states of a quantum spin chain there exists a translation invariant finite-range Hamiltonian for which this set is the set of ground states. This result implies that there are GVBS models with arbitrary broken discrete symmetries that are described as combinations of lattice translations, lattice reflections, and local unitary or anti-unitary transformations. We also show that all GVBS models that satisfy some natural conditions have a spectral gap. The existence of a spectral gap is obtained by applying a simple and quite general strategy for proving lower bounds on the spectral gap of the generator of a classical or quantum spin dynamics. This general scheme is interesting in its own right and threfore, although the basic idea is not new, we present it in a system-independent setting. The results are illustrated with a number of examples.},

@article{oreshkov_adiabatic_2010,
	Abstract = {We propose a theory of adiabaticity in quantum Markovian dynamics based on a decomposition of the Hilbert space induced by the asymptotic behavior of the Lindblad semigroup. A central idea of our approach is that the natural generalization of the concept of eigenspace of the Hamiltonian in the case of Markovian dynamics is a noiseless subsystem with a minimal noisy cofactor. Unlike previous attempts to define adiabaticity for open systems, our approach deals exclusively with physical entities and provides a simple, intuitive picture at the Hilbert-space level, linking the notion of adiabaticity to the theory of noiseless subsystems. As two applications of our theory, we propose a general framework for decoherence-assisted computation in noiseless codes and a dissipation-driven approach to holonomic computation based on adiabatic dragging of subsystems that is generally not achievable by nondissipative means.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a self-consistent framework for the analysis of both Abelian and non-Abelian geometric phases associated with open quantum systems, undergoing cyclic adiabatic evolution. We derive a general expression for geometric phases, based on an adiabatic approximation developed within an inherently open-systems approach. This expression provides a natural generalization of the analogous one for closed quantum systems, and we prove that it satisfies all the properties one might expect of a good definition of a geometric phase, including gauge invariance. A striking consequence is the emergence of a finite time interval for the observation of geometric phases. The formalism is illustrated via the canonical example of a spin-1/2{\textless}math display="inline" baseline="-2.5" altimg="none"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}∕{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}2{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} particle in a time-dependent magnetic field.

Based on this criterion and rather general arguments and assumptions, it can be demonstrated that a run-time T{\textless}math display="inline" altimg="none"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}T{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} of order of the inverse minimum energy gap ΔEmin{\textless}math display="inline" altimg="none"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}Δ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}E{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="normal"{\textgreater}min{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} is sufficient and necessary, i.e., T=O(ΔE−1min){\textless}math display="inline" altimg="none"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}T{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}={\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}O{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}({\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}Δ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}msubsup{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}E{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi \_moz-math-font-style="normal"{\textgreater}min{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}−{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msubsup{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}){\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}.

	Abstract = {We construct a large class of completely positive and trace-preserving non-Markovian dynamical maps for an open quantum system. These maps arise from a piecewise dynamics for statistical operators characterized by a continuous time evolution interrupted by jumps, randomly distributed in time and described by a quantum channel. The state of the open system is shown to obey a closed evolution equation, given by a master equation with a memory kernel and an inhomogeneous term. The non-Markovianity of the obtained dynamics is explicitly assessed studying the behavior of the distinguishability of two different initial system's states with elapsing time.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the problem of counting the maximum number of distinct states that an isolated physical system can pass through in a given period of time ---its maximum speed of dynamical evolution. Previous analyses have given bounds in terms of ΔE, the standard deviation of the energy of the system; here we give a strict bound that depends only on E −E0, the system's average energy minus its ground state energy. We also discuss bounds on information processing rates implied by our bound on the speed of dynamical evolution. For example, adding 1 J of energy to a given computer can never increase its processing rate by more than about 3 ×1033 operations per second.},

	N2 = {Spontaneous synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon, important in many theoretical studies and applications. Recently this effect has been analyzed and observed in a number of physical systems close to the quantum mechanical regime. In this work we propose the mutual information as a useful order parameter which can capture the emergence of synchronization in very different contexts, ranging from semi-classical to intrinsically quantum mechanical systems. Specifically we first study the synchronization of two coupled Van der Pol oscillators in both classical and quantum regimes and later we consider the synchronization of two qubits inside two coupled optical cavities. In all these contexts, we find that mutual information can be used as an appropriate figure of merit for determining the synchronization phases, independently of the specific details of the system.},

	N2 = {If frequent measurements ascertain whether a quantum system is still in its initial state, transitions to other states are hindered and the quantum Zeno effect takes place. However, in its broader formulation, the quantum Zeno effect does not necessarily freeze everything. In contrast, for frequent projections onto a multidimensional subspace, the system can evolve away from its initial state, although it remains in the subspace defined by the measurement. The continuing time evolution within the projected 'quantum Zeno subspace' is called 'quantum Zeno dynamics': for instance, if the measurements ascertain whether a quantum particle is in a given spatial region, the evolution is unitary and the generator of the Zeno dynamics is the Hamiltonian with hard-wall (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. We discuss the physical and mathematical aspects of this evolution, highlighting the open mathematical problems. We then analyze some alternative strategies to obtain a Zeno dynamics and show that they are physically equivalent.},

More specifically, the function V to be minimized is viewed as the potential energy term in a Schr{\"o}dinger Hamiltonian H for a quantum spin 1/2 system, the kinetic energy term being the generator of a random walk tailored to the neighborhood structure associated with V The distorted random walk associated with (a suitable approximation of) the ground state eigenfunction of H defines then our approximate optimization strategy. A numerical application to the graph partitioning problem is presented.},

Dissipation then does not occur as a perturbation, but rather as the main resource for many-body dynamics, providing a targeted cooling into topological phases starting from arbitrary initial states. We explore the concept of topological order in this setting, developing and applying a general theoretical framework based on the system density matrix that replaces the wave function appropriate for the discussion of Hamiltonian ground-state physics. We identify key analogies and differences to the more conventional Hamiltonian scenario. Differences essentially arise from the fact that the properties of the spectrum and of the state of the system are not as tightly related as in the Hamiltonian context. We provide a symmetry-based topological classification of bulk steady states and identify the classes that are achievable by means of quasi-local dissipative processes driving into superfluid paired states. We also explore the fate of the bulk-edge correspondence in the dissipative setting and demonstrate the emergence of Majorana edge modes. We illustrate our findings in one- and two-dimensional models that are experimentally realistic in the context of cold atoms.},

The area law for a 1D system states that for the ground state, the entanglement of any interval is upper bounded by a constant independent of the size of the interval. However, the possible dependence of the upper bound on the spectral gap Δ is not known, as the best known general upper bound is asymptotically much larger than the largest possible entropy of any model system previously constructed for small Δ. To help resolve this asymptotic behavior, we construct a family of 1D local systems for which some intervals have entanglement entropy, which is polynomial in 1/Δ, whereas previously studied systems, such as free fermion systems or systems described by conformal field theory, had the entropy of all intervals bounded by a constant time log(1/Δ).},

@article{Howard:2014fk,
	Abstract = {Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the source of the power in quantum computing has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via /`magic state/' distillation, which is the leading model for experimentally realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. This is a conceptually satisfying link, because contextuality, which precludes a simple /`hidden variable/' model of quantum mechanics, provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the non-locality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality, and non-locality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation, and putting bounds on the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a set of quantum adiabatic evolutions that we argue may be used as ``building blocks,'' or subroutines, in the construction of an adiabatic algorithm that executes Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) with the same complexity and resources as its gate-model counterpart. One implication of the above construction is the theoretical feasibility of implementing Shor's algorithm for integer factorization in an optimal manner, and any other algorithm that makes use of QFT, on quantum annealing devices. We discuss the possible advantages, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach as well as its relation to traditional adiabatic quantum computation.},

We combine this expression with a known efficient classical algorithm for the Ising partition function of any planar graph in the absence of an external magnetic field, and the Robertson--Seymour theorem from graph theory. We give as an example a set of quantum circuits with a small number of non-nearest-neighbor gates which admit an efficient classical simulation.},

	N2 = {Quantum information science explores the frontier of highly complex quantum states, the "entanglement frontier." This study is motivated by the observation (widely believed but unproven) that classical systems cannot simulate highly entangled quantum systems efficiently, and we hope to hasten the day when well controlled quantum systems can perform tasks surpassing what can be done in the classical world. One way to achieve such "quantum supremacy" would be to run an algorithm on a quantum computer which solves a problem with a super-polynomial speedup relative to classical computers, but there may be other ways that can be achieved sooner, such as simulating exotic quantum states of strongly correlated matter. To operate a large scale quantum computer reliably we will need to overcome the debilitating effects of decoherence, which might be done using "standard" quantum hardware protected by quantum error-correcting codes, or by exploiting the nonabelian quantum statistics of anyons realized in solid state systems, or by combining both methods. Only by challenging the entanglement frontier will we learn whether Nature provides extravagant resources far beyond what the classical world would allow.},

	N2 = {A major challenge facing adiabatic quantum computing is that algorithm design and error correction can be difficult for adiabatic quantum computing. Recent work has considered addressing his challenge by using coherently controlled adiabatic evolutions in the place of classically controlled evolution. An important question remains: what is the relative power of controlled adiabatic evolution to traditional adiabatic evolutions? We address this by showing that coherent control and measurement provides a way to average different adiabatic evolutions in ways that cause their diabatic errors to cancel, allowing for adiabatic evolutions to combine the best characteristics of existing adiabatic optimizations strategies that are mutually exclusive in conventional adiabatic QIP. This result shows that coherent control and measurement can provide advantages for adiabatic state preparation. We also provide upper bounds on the complexity of simulating such evolutions on a circuit based quantum computer and provide sufficiency conditions for the equivalence of controlled adiabatic evolutions to adiabatic quantum computing.},

	N2 = {We study complexity of several problems related to the Transverse field Ising Model (TIM). First, we consider the problem of estimating the ground state energy known as the Local Hamiltonian Problem (LHP). It is shown that the LHP for TIM on degree-3 graphs is equivalent modulo polynomial reductions to the LHP for general k-local `stoquastic' Hamiltonians with any constant $k\ge 2$. This result implies that estimating the ground state energy of TIM on degree-3 graphs is a complete problem for the complexity class StoqMA - an extension of the classical class MA. As a corollary, we complete the complexity classification of 2-local Hamiltonians with a fixed set of interactions proposed recently by Cubitt and Montanaro. Secondly, we study quantum annealing algorithms for finding ground states of classical spin Hamiltonians associated with hard optimization problems. We prove that the quantum annealing with TIM Hamiltonians is equivalent modulo polynomial reductions to the quantum annealing with a certain subclass of k-local stoquastic Hamiltonians. This subclass includes all Hamiltonians representable as a sum of a k-local diagonal Hamiltonian and a 2-local stoquastic Hamiltonian.},

	N2 = {We review here some recent work in the field of quantum annealing, alias adiabatic quantum computation. The idea of quantum annealing is to perform optimization by a quantum adiabatic evolution which tracks the ground state of a suitable time-dependent Hamiltonian, where ' ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/planck.gif] {planck} ' is slowly switched off. We illustrate several applications of quantum annealing strategies, starting from textbook toy-models---double-well potentials and other one-dimensional examples, with and without disorder. These examples display in a clear way the crucial differences between classical and quantum annealing. We then discuss applications of quantum annealing to challenging hard optimization problems, such as the random Ising model, the travelling salesman problem and Boolean satisfiability problems. The techniques used to implement quantum annealing are either deterministic Schr{\"o}dinger's evolutions, for the toy models, or path-integral Monte Carlo and Green's function Monte Carlo approaches, for the hard optimization problems. The crucial role played by disorder and the associated non-trivial Landau--Zener tunnelling phenomena is discussed and emphasized.},

Working in a common model of fault-tolerance, I show that in the asymptotic limit of large circuits, the ratio of physical qubits to logical qubits can be a constant. The construction makes use of quantum low-density parity check codes, and the asymptotic overhead of the protocol is equal to that of the family of quantum error-correcting codes underlying the fault-tolerant protocol.},

	N2 = {Quantum computation has revolutionary potential for speeding computational tasks such as factoring and simulating quantum systems, but the task of constructing a quantum computer is daunting. Adiabatic quantum computation and other ``hands-off" approaches relieve the need for rapid, precise pulsing to control the system, inspiring at least one high-profile effort to realize a hands-off quantum computing device. But is hands-off incompatible with fault-tolerant? Concerted effort and many innovative ideas have not resolved this question but have instead deepened it, linking it to fundamental problems in quantum complexity theory. Here we present a hands-off approach that is provably (a) capable of scalable universal quantum computation in a non-degenerate ground state and (b) fault-tolerant against an analogue of the usual local stochastic fault model. A satisfying physical and numerical argument indicates that (c) it is also fault-tolerant against thermal excitation below a threshold temperature independent of the computation size.},

	N2 = {While adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) has some robustness to noise and decoherence, it is widely believed that encoding, error suppression and error correction will be required to scale AQC to large problem sizes. Previous works have established at least two different techniques for error suppression in AQC. In this paper we derive a model for describing the dynamics of encoded AQC and show that previous constructions for error suppression can be unified with this dynamical model. In addition, the model clarifies the mechanisms of error suppression and allows the identification of its weaknesses. In the second half of the paper, we utilize our description of non-equilibrium dynamics in encoded AQC to construct methods for error correction in AQC by cooling local degrees of freedom (qubits). While this is shown to be possible in principle, we also identify the key challenge to this approach: the requirement of high-weight Hamiltonians. Finally, we use our dynamical model to perform a simplified thermal stability analysis of concatenated-stabilizer-code encoded many-body systems for AQC or quantum memories. This work is a companion paper to `Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation: techniques and challenges (2013 Phys. Rev. X 3 041013)', which provides a quantum information perspective on the techniques and limitations of error suppression and correction in AQC. In this paper we couch the same results within a dynamical framework, which allows for a detailed analysis of the non-equilibrium dynamics of error suppression and correction in encoded AQC.},

	Abstract = {Quantum technology is maturing to the point where quantum devices, such as quantum communication systems, quantum random number generators and quantum simulators may be built with capabilities exceeding classical computers. A quantum annealer, in particular, solves optimization problems by evolving a known initial configuration at non-zero temperature towards the ground state of a Hamiltonian encoding a given problem. Here, we present results from tests on a 108 qubit D-Wave One device based on superconducting flux qubits. By studying correlations we find that the device performance is inconsistent with classical annealing or that it is governed by classical spin dynamics. In contrast, we find that the device correlates well with simulated quantum annealing. We find further evidence for quantum annealing in the form of small-gap avoided level crossings characterizing the hard problems. To assess the computational power of the device we compare it against optimized classical algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Quantum information processing offers dramatic speedups, yet is susceptible to decoherence, whereby quantum superpositions decay into mutually exclusive classical alternatives, thus robbing quantum computers of their power. This makes the development of quantum error correction an essential aspect of quantum computing. So far, little is known about protection against decoherence for quantum annealing, a computational paradigm aiming to exploit ground-state quantum dynamics to solve optimization problems more rapidly than is possible classically. Here we develop error correction for quantum annealing and experimentally demonstrate it using antiferromagnetic chains with up to 344 superconducting flux qubits in processors that have recently been shown to physically implement programmable quantum annealing. We demonstrate a substantial improvement over the performance of the processors in the absence of error correction. These results pave the way towards large-scale noise-protected adiabatic quantum optimization devices, although a threshold theorem such as has been established in the circuit model of quantum computing remains elusive.},

The method is based on the motion reversal of random unitary operators. In the simplest case our method enables direct estimation of the average gate fidelity. The more general fidelities are characterized by a universal exponential rate of fidelity loss. In all cases the measurable fidelity decrease is directly related to the strength of the noise affecting the implementation, quantified by the trace of the superoperator describing the non-unitary dynamics. While the scalability of our stochastic protocol makes it most relevant in large Hilbert spaces (when quantum process tomography is infeasible), our method should be immediately useful for evaluating the degree of control that is achievable in any prototype quantum processing device. By varying over different experimental arrangements and error-correction strategies, additional information about the noise can be determined.},

Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis},

The ground state of the initial Hamiltonian is easy to construct; the ground state of the final Hamiltonian encodes the solution of the computational problem. These algorithms have generally been studied in the case where the "straight line" path from initial to final Hamiltonian is taken. But there is no reason not to try paths involving terms that are not linear combinations of the initial and final Hamiltonians. We give several proposals for randomly generating new paths. Using one of these proposals, we convert an algorithmic failure into a success. },

@article{Berkley:2010zr,
	Abstract = {We have designed, fabricated and tested an XY-addressable readout system that is specifically tailored for the reading of superconducting flux qubits in an integrated circuit that could enable adiabatic quantum optimization. In such a system, the flux qubits only need to be read at the end of an adiabatic evolution when quantum mechanical tunneling has been suppressed, thus simplifying many aspects of the readout process. The readout architecture for an N -qubit adiabatic quantum optimization system comprises N hysteretic dc SQUIDs and N rf SQUID latches controlled by ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-2048/23/10/105014/sust351878ieqn1.gif] {2\sqrt {N}+2} bias lines. The latching elements are coupled to the qubits and the dc SQUIDs are then coupled to the latching elements. This readout scheme provides two key advantages: first, the latching elements provide exceptional flux sensitivity that significantly exceeds what may be achieved by directly coupling the flux qubits to the dc SQUIDs using a practical mutual inductance. Second, the states of the latching elements are robust against the influence of ac currents generated by the switching of the hysteretic dc SQUIDs, thus allowing one to interrogate the latching elements repeatedly so as to mitigate the effects of stochastic switching of the dc SQUIDs. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve single-qubit read error rates of < 10 − 6 with this readout scheme. We have characterized the system level performance of a 128-qubit readout system and have measured a readout error probability of 8 × 10 − 5 in the presence of optimal latching element bias conditions.},

In order to define the junction size and protect its top electrode during anodic oxidation, we developed and used the new concept of an aluminum hard mask. Josephson junctions of sizes down to 0.5 µm2 have been fabricated and thoroughly characterized. We found that they have a very high quality, which is witnessed by the {IV} curves with quality parameters Vm {\textgreater} 50 {mV} and Vgap = 2.8 {mV} at 4.2 K, as well as {IcRN} products of 1.75--1.93 {mV} obtained at lower temperatures. In order to test the usability of our fabrication process for superconducting quantum bits, we have also designed, fabricated and experimentally investigated phase qubits made of these junctions. We found a relaxation time of T1 = 26 ns and a dephasing time of T2 = 21 ns.},

@article{Matsuda:2009uq,
	Abstract = {We study the performance of quantum annealing for systems with ground-state degeneracy by directly solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for small systems and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for larger systems. The results indicate that naive quantum annealing using a transverse field may not be well suited to identify all degenerate ground-state configurations, although the value of the ground-state energy is often efficiently estimated. An introduction of quantum transitions to all states with equal weights is shown to greatly improve the situation, but with a sacrifice in annealing time. We also clarify the relation between the spin configurations in degenerate ground states and the probabilities that those states are obtained by quantum annealing. The strengths and weaknesses of quantum annealing for problems with degenerate ground states are discussed in comparison with classical simulated annealing.},

@article{chiaverini_realization_2004,
	Abstract = {Scalable quantum computation and communication require error control to protect quantum information against unavoidable noise. Quantum error correction protects information stored in two-level quantum systems (qubits) by rectifying errors with operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes. Error-correction protocols have been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, but the inherent limitations of this technique prevent its application to quantum information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate quantum error correction using three beryllium atomic-ion qubits confined to a linear, multi-zone trap. An encoded one-qubit state is protected against spin-flip errors by means of a three-qubit quantum error-correcting code. A primary ion qubit is prepared in an initial state, which is then encoded into an entangled state of three physical qubits (the primary and two ancilla qubits). Errors are induced simultaneously in all qubits at various rates. The encoded state is decoded back to the primary ion one-qubit state, making error information available on the ancilla ions, which are separated from the primary ion and measured. Finally, the primary qubit state is corrected on the basis of the ancillae measurement outcome. We verify error correction by comparing the corrected final state to the uncorrected state and to the initial state. In principle, the approach enables a quantum state to be maintained by means of repeated error correction, an important step towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation using trapped ions.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a mapping between graphs and pure quantum bipartite states and show that the associated entanglement entropy conveys non-trivial information about the structure of the graph. Our primary goal is to investigate the family of random graphs known as complex networks. In the case of classical random graphs, we derive an analytic expression for the averaged entanglement entropy ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/14/1/013011/nj408157ieqn1.gif] {$\bar S$} while for general complex networks we rely on numerics. For a large number of nodes n we find a scaling ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/14/1/013011/nj408157ieqn2.gif] {$\bar {S} \sim c \log n +g_{\mathrm {e}}$} where both the prefactor c and the sub-leading O (1) term g e are characteristic of the different classes of complex networks. In particular, g e encodes topological features of the graphs and is named network topological entropy. Our results suggest that quantum entanglement may provide a powerful tool for the analysis of large complex networks with non-trivial topological properties.},

@article{Zanardi:2013km,
	Abstract = {Generic quantum states in the Hilbert space of a many-body system are nearly maximally entangled whereas low-energy physical states are not; the so-called area laws for quantum entanglement are widespread. In this paper we introduce the novel concept of entanglement susceptibility by expanding the 2-R{\'e}nyi entropy in the boundary couplings. We show how this concept leads to the emergence of area laws for bi-partite quantum entanglement in systems ruled by local gapped Hamiltonians. Entanglement susceptibility also captures quantitatively which violations one should expect when the system becomes gapless. We also discuss an exact series expansion of the 2-R{\'e}nyi entanglement entropy in terms of connected correlation functions of a boundary term. This is obtained by identifying R{\'e}nyi entropy with ground state fidelity in a doubled and twisted theory.},

	Abstract = {We develop a theory of adiabatic response for open systems governed by Lindblad evolutions. The theory determines the dependence of the response coefficients on the dephasing rates and allows for residual dissipation even when the ground state is protected by a spectral gap . We give the quantum response a geometric interpretation in terms of Hilbert space projections: for a two-level system and, more generally, for systems with a suitable functional form of the dephasing, the dissipative and non-dissipative parts of the response are linked to a metric and to a symplectic form. The metric is the Fubini--Study metric and the symplectic form is the adiabatic curvature. When the metric and symplectic structures are compatible , the non-dissipative part of the inverse matrix of response coefficients turns out to be immune to dephasing . We give three examples of physical systems whose quantum states induce compatible metric and symplectic structures on control space: qubit, coherent states and a model of the integer quantum Hall effect.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the Uhlmann geometric phase as a tool to characterize symmetry protected topological phases in 1D fermion systems, such as topological insulators and superconductors. Since this phase is formulated for general mixed quantum states, it provides a way to to extend the notion of topological properties to finite temperature situations. We illustrate these ideas with some paradigmatic models and find that there exists a critical temperature $T_c$ at which the Uhlmann phase goes discontinuously and abruptly to zero. This stands a borderline between two different topological phases as a function of the temperature. Furthermore, at small temperatures we recover the usual notion of topological phase in fermion systems. },

@article{cai2013algebraic,
	Abstract = {The interplay between dissipation and internal interactions in quantum many-body systems gives rise to a wealth of novel phenomena. Here we investigate spin-1/2 chains with uniform local couplings to a Markovian environment using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG). For the open XXZ model, we discover that the decoherence time diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The coherence decay is then algebraic instead of exponential. This is due to a vanishing gap in the spectrum of the corresponding Liouville superoperator and can be explained on the basis of a perturbative treatment. In contrast, decoherence in the open transverse-field Ising model is found to be always exponential. In this case, the internal interactions can both facilitate and impede the environment-induced decoherence. },

	Abstract = {We generalize the method of third quantization to a unified exact treatment of Redfield and Lindblad master equations for open quadratic systems of n fermions in terms of diagonalization of a 4 n ×4 n matrix. Non-equilibrium thermal driving in terms of the Redfield equation is analyzed in detail. We explain how one can compute all the physically relevant quantities, such as non-equilibrium expectation values of local observables, various entropies or information measures, or time evolution and properties of relaxation. We also discuss how to exactly treat explicitly time-dependent problems. The general formalism is then applied to study a thermally driven open XY spin 1/2 chain. We find that the recently proposed non-equilibrium quantum phase transition in the open XY chain survives the thermal driving within the Redfield model. In particular, the phase of long-range magnetic correlations can be characterized by hypersensitivity of the non-equilibrium steady state to external (bath or bulk) parameters. Studying the heat transport, we find negative differential thermal conductance for sufficiently strong thermal driving as well as non-monotonic dependence of the heat current on the strength of the bath coupling.},

	Abstract = {We study the connection between Berry phases and quantum phase transitions of generic quantum many-body systems. Consider sequences of Berry phases associated to sequences of loops in the parameter space whose limit is a point. If the sequence of Berry phases does not converge to zero, then the limit point is a quantum critical point. Quantum critical points are associated to failures of adiabaticity. We discuss the remarkable example of the anisotropic XY spin chain in a transverse magnetic field and detect the XX region of criticality. },

The phases within a given class are further characterized by a topological invariant, an element of some Abelian group that can be 0, Z, or Z_2. The interface between two infinite phases with different topological numbers must carry some gapless mode. Topological properties of finite systems are described in terms of K-homology. This classification is robust with respect to disorder, provided electron states near the Fermi energy are absent or localized. In some cases (e.g., integer quantum Hall systems) the K-theoretic classification is stable to interactions, but a counterexample is also given. },

@article{Peng:2011ly,
	Abstract = {Quantum information processing requires overcoming decoherence---the loss of 'quantumness' due to the inevitable interaction between the quantum system and its environment. One approach towards a solution is quantum dynamical decoupling---a method employing strong and frequent pulses applied to the qubits. Here we report on the first experimental test of the concatenated dynamical decoupling (CDD) scheme, which invokes recursively constructed pulse sequences. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, we demonstrate a near order of magnitude improvement in the decay time of stored quantum states. In conjunction with recent results on high fidelity quantum gates using CDD, our results suggest that quantum dynamical decoupling should be used as a first layer of defense against decoherence in quantum information processing implementations, and can be a stand-alone solution in the right parameter regime.},

@article{DiVincenzo:2000kx,
	Abstract = {Various physical implementations of quantum computers are being investigated, although the requirements that must be met to make such devices a reality in the laboratory at present involve capabilities well beyond the state of the art. Recent solid-state approaches have used quantum dots, donor-atom nuclear spins or electron spins; in these architectures, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable exchange interaction between spins (a Heisenberg interaction), whereas the one-qubit gates require control over a local magnetic field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit operations are significantly slower, requiring substantially greater materials and device complexity--potentially contributing to a detrimental increase in the decoherence rate. Here we introduced an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction alone suffices to implement exactly any quantum computer circuit. This capability comes at a price of a factor of three in additional qubits, and about a factor of ten in additional two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards solid-state implementations of quantum computation.},

	Abstract = {Electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots are promising candidates for the experimental realization of solid-state qubits. We analyse the dynamics of a system of three qubits arranged in a linear geometry and a system of four qubits arranged in a square geometry. Calculations are performed for several quantum dot confining potentials. In the three-qubit case, three-body effects are identified that have an important quantitative influence upon quantum computation. In the four-qubit case, the full Hamiltonian is found to include both three-body and four-body interactions that significantly influence the dynamics in physically relevant parameter regimes. We consider the implications of these results for the encoded universality paradigm applied to the four-electron qubit code; in particular, we consider what is required to circumvent the four-body effects in an encoded system (four spins per encoded qubit) by the appropriate tuning of experimental parameters.},

The story of this study starts with classical complexity and takes unexpected turns providing fascinating vistas on the foundations of quantum mechanics, the global nature of entanglement and its topological properties, quantum error correction, information theory, and much more; it raises questions that touch upon some of the most fundamental issues at the heart of our understanding of quantum mechanics. At this point, the jury is still out as to whether or not such a theorem holds. This survey aims to provide a snapshot of the status in this ongoing story, tailored to a general theory-of-CS audience. },

Being able to tackle problems that are intractable on classical computers, quantum simulators would provide a means of exploring new physical phenomena. We present an overview of how quantum simulators may become a reality in the near future as the required technologies are now within reach. Quantum simulators, relying on the coherent control of neutral atoms, ions, photons, or electrons, would allow studying problems in various fields including condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, cosmology, atomic physics, and quantum chemistry.},

Broad and important applications must be found to justify construction of a quantum computer; I review some of the known quantum algorithms and consider the prospects for finding new ones. Quantum computers are notoriously susceptible to making errors; I discuss recently developed fault–tolerant procedures that enable a quantum computer with noisy gates to perform reliably. Quantum computing hardware is still in its infancy; I comment on the specifications that should be met by future hardware. Over the past few years, work on quantum computation has erected a new classification of computational complexity, has generated profound insights into the nature of decoherence, and has stimulated the formulation of new techniques in high–precision experimental physics. A broad interdisciplinary effort will be needed if quantum computers are to fulfil their destiny as the world's fastest computing devices. This paper is an expanded version of remarks that were prepared for a panel discussion at the ITP Conference on Quantum Coherence and Decoherence, December 1996.},

In quantum dynamics we must avoid explicitly measuring the work directly, which is tantamount to continuously monitoring the state of the system, and instead measure the heat flow from the environment. These measurements can be concisely represented with Hermitian map superoperators, which provide convenient and compact representations of correlation functions and sequential measurements of quantum systems.},

@article{Vega:2010fk,
	Abstract = {According to recent studies (Amin et al 2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 060503), the effect of a thermal bath may improve the performance of a quantum adiabatic search algorithm. In this paper, we compare the effects of such a thermal environment on the algorithm performance with those of a structured environment similar to the one encountered in systems coupled to an electromagnetic field that exists within a photonic crystal. Whereas for all the parameter regimes explored here, the algorithm performance is worsened by contact with a thermal environment, the picture appears to be different when one considers a structured environment. In this case we show that by tuning the environment parameters to certain regimes, the algorithm performance can actually be improved with respect to the closed system case. Additionally, the relevance of considering the dissipation rates as complex quantities is discussed in both cases. More specifically, we find that the imaginary part of the rates cannot be neglected with the usual argument that it simply amounts to an energy shift and in fact influences crucially the system dynamics.},

@article{Wiebe:12,
	Abstract = {We present a new technique that improves the scaling of the error in the adiabatic approximation with respect to the evolution duration, thereby permitting faster transfer at a fixed error tolerance. Our method is conceptually different from previously proposed techniques: it exploits a commonly overlooked phase interference effect that occurs predictably at specific evolution times, suppressing transitions away from the adiabatically transferred eigenstate. Our method can be used in concert with existing adiabatic optimization techniques, such as local adiabatic evolutions or boundary cancelation methods. We perform a full error analysis of our phase interference method along with existing boundary cancelation techniques and show a tradeoff between error-scaling and experimental precision. We illustrate these findings using two examples, showing improved error-scaling for an adiabatic search algorithm and a tunable two-qubit quantum logic gate.},

	Abstract = {The adiabatic approximation in open systems is formulated through the effective Hamiltonian approach. By introducing an ancilla, we embed the open system dynamics into a non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of a composite system composed of the open system and ancilla, the adiabatic evolution of the open system is then defined as the adiabatic dynamics of the composite system. Validity and invalidity conditions for this approximation as well as the relation to the other definition are established and discussed. A high-order adiabatic approximation for open systems is introduced. As an example, the adiabatic condition for an open spin- ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-4075/40/2/004/jpb235369ieqn1.gif] {\frac 1 2} particle in time-dependent magnetic fields is analysed.},

	Abstract = {Consider a path of non-degenerate eigenstates of unitary operators or Hamiltonians with minimum eigenvalue gap G. The eigenpath traversal problem is to transform one or more copies of the initial to the final eigenstate. Solutions to this problem have applications ranging from quantum physics simulation to optimization. For Hamiltonians, the conventional way of doing this is by applying the adiabatic theorem. We give ``digital'' methods for performing the transformation that require no assumption on path continuity or differentiability other than the absence of large jumps. Given sufficient information about eigenvalues and overlaps between states on the path, the transformation can be accomplished with complexity {O(L/G} {log(L/e))}, where L is the angular length of the path and e is a specified bound on the error of the output state. We show that the required information can be obtained in a first set of transformations, whose complexity per state transformed has an additional factor that depends logarithmically on a maximum angular velocity along the path. This velocity is averaged over constant angular distances and does not require continuity. Our methods have substantially better behavior than conventional adiabatic algorithms, with fewer conditions on the path. They also improve on the previously best digital methods and demonstrate that path length and the gap are the primary parameters that determine the complexity of state transformation along a path.},

@article{yung_thermal_2008,
	Abstract = {The success of adiabatic quantum computation {(AQC)} depends crucially on the ability to maintain the quantum computer in the ground state of the evolution Hamiltonian. The computation process has to be sufficiently slow as restricted by the minimal energy gap. However, at finite temperatures, it might need to be fast enough to avoid thermal excitations. The question is, how fast does it need to be? The structure of evolution Hamiltonians for {AQC} is generally too complicated for answering this question. Here we model an adiabatic quantum computer as a (parametrically driven) harmonic oscillator. The advantages of this model are (1) it offers high flexibility for quantitative analysis on the thermal effect, (2) the results qualitatively agree with previous numerical calculation, and (3) it could be experimentally verified with quantum electronic circuits.},

	Abstract = {Traditional simulated annealing uses thermal fluctuations for convergence in optimization problems. Quantum tunneling provides a different mechanism for moving between states, with the potential for reduced time scales. Thermal and quantum annealing are compared in a model disordered magnet, where the effects of quantum mechanics can be tuned by varying an applied magnetic field. The results indicate that quantum annealing hastens convergence to the optimum state.},

@article{WL3D,
	Abstract = {We investigate the performance of flat-histogram methods based on a multicanonical ensemble and the Wang‚{\"A}{\`\i}Landau algorithm for the three-dimensional ¬$\pm$ J spin glass by measuring round-trip times in the energy range between the zero-temperature ground state and the state of highest energy. Strong sample-to-sample variations are found for fixed system size and the distribution of round-trip times follows a fat-tailed Fr√{\copyright}chet extremal value distribution. Rare events in the fat tails of these distributions corresponding to extremely slowly equilibrating spin glass realizations dominate the calculations of statistical averages. While the typical round-trip times scale exponentially as expected for this NP-hard problem, we find that the average round-trip time is no longer well defined for systems with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/07/P07008/jstat183159ieqn1.gif] {N \geq 8^3} spins. We relate the round-trip times for multicanonical sampling to intrinsic properties of the energy landscape and compare with the numerical effort needed by the genetic cluster-exact approximation to calculate the exact ground-state energies. For systems with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/07/P07008/jstat183159ieqn2.gif] {N \geq 8^3} spins the simulation of these rare events becomes increasingly hard. For ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/07/P07008/jstat183159ieqn3.gif] {N \geq 14^3} there are samples where the Wang‚{\"A}{\`\i}Landau algorithm fails to find the true ground state within reasonable simulation times. We expect similar behaviour for other algorithms based on multicanonical sampling.},

	Abstract = {The fundamental unit for quantum computing is the qubit, an isolated, controllable two-level system. However, for many proposed quantum computer architectures, especially photonic systems, the qubits can be lost or can leak out of the desired two-level systems, posing a significant obstacle for practical quantum computation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, both in the quantum circuit model and in the one-way quantum computer model, the smallest nontrivial quantum codes to tackle this problem. In the experiment, we encode single-qubit input states into highly entangled multiparticle code words, and we test their ability to protect encoded quantum information from detected 1-qubit loss error. Our results prove in-principle the feasibility of overcoming the qubit loss error by quantum codes.},

	Note = {Dubuc {\it et al.} \cite{Dubuc} introduced a method particularly well suited for the evaluation of the self-affinity exponent. In particular, they demonstrate that their method has the stablest {\em local} exponent in comparison to a variety of other methods, such as box-counting and power-spectrum. Briefly, in their notation, the $\epsilon$-variation of a function $f$ is $V(\epsilon,f) = \int_0^1 v(x,\epsilon) dx$, where the $\epsilon$ oscillation $v(x,\epsilon)$ is: $v(x,\epsilon) = \sup_{x' \in R_{\epsilon}(x)} f(x') - \inf_{x' \in R_{\epsilon}(x)} f(x')$, and where $R_{\epsilon}(x) = \{s \in [0,1]: |x-s|<\epsilon \}$. The corresponding log-log plot for the calculation of the self-affinity exponent is $\left[ \log(1/\epsilon),\log(V(\epsilon,f)/\epsilon^2)\right]$, with the exponent given by 2--slope.}}

To obtain this distribution we will maximize the missing information $S$ given by: \begin{eqnarray*} S = - \int_0^{\infty} P(x) \, \ln P(x) \,dx \end{eqnarray*} under the constraint \begin{eqnarray*} \rho^{-1} = \langle x \rangle = \int_0^{\infty} x\, P(x) \,dx. \end{eqnarray*} Maximizing $S$ under this and the probability normalization constraint (using Lagrange multipliers) one finds that \cite{me:random-model} \begin{eqnarray*} P(x) = {1 \over \rho}\, e^{-{x \over \rho}}. \end{eqnarray*} We conclude that a uniform random distribution is generic for physical processes in which only the first moment (the density) is determined from outside. The above information-theory formalism can also be used to derive the distributions when higher moments are also given, which quantify correlations.}}

	Note = {A much richer class of dilations is possible by employing a general linear transformation, i.e., representing $s$ by matrix. Not all such transformations can be conveniently represented in exponential form with a single exponential, but many of them can. In particular, $\exp(x_i S_{ij} \partial_{x_j}) f(x) = f(s x), s=\exp(S)$. This general $s$ is capable of providing a simultaneous rotation and stretch along arbitrarily directed axes with individual factors for each axis.}}

Then: $\sum_i^n a_i/\sum_i^n b_i = (a_1/b_1)(b_1/\sum_i^n b_i) + \sum_{j=2}^n (a_j/b_j)(b_j/\sum_{i=1}^n b_i) \leq (a_1/b_1)\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i/\sum_{i=1}^n b_i) = a_1/b_1$. For the other direction, take $a_1/b_1 = \min_i^n (a_i/b_i)$. This proves Eq.(\ref{eq:ineq}).}}

	Note = {For a quick derivation, suppose ${\bf A}$ diagonalizes $\brho^C(0)$: $[{\bf A} \brho^C(0) {\bf A}^{-1}]_{i j} \!=\! \lambda_i \delta_{i j}$. Since $\brho^C(0)$ is a density matrix, it is Hermitian so a (unitary) such ${\bf A}$ exists, and moreover $0 \le \lambda_i \le 1$, $\forall i$. Let $\brho'(t) \!\equiv\! {\bf A} \brho^C(t) {\bf A}^{-1}$. Then ${\rm Tr} \brho'(t) \!=\! {\rm Tr} \brho^C(t) \!=\! 1$ since the trace is invariant under cyclic permutation of its arguments and $\brho^C(t)$ is itself a density matrix. Now: ${\rm Tr} [\brho^C(0)\brho^C(t)] \!=\! {\rm Tr} [({\bf A} \brho^C(0) {\bf A}^{-1})\brho'(t)] \!=\! \sum_{i j} \lambda_i \delta_{i j} [\brho'(t)]_{j i} \!=\! \sum_i \lambda_i [\brho'(t)]_{i i} \le \sum_i [\brho'(t)]_{i i} \!=\! {\rm Tr} \brho'(t) \!=\! 1$, so $F(t) \!\le\! 1$. Equality is achieved only if just one of the $\lambda_i$'s is 1 (say $\lambda_1$, all others 0), i.e., is a pure state (then ${\bf A}$ is the identity), and at the same time $[\brho'(t)]_{1 1} \!=\! [\brho^C(t)]_{1 1} \!=\! 1$, i.e., $\brho^C(t) \!=\! \brho^C(0)$.}}

The most general transformation on this vector is a rotation $+$ contraction (described by an $(N^{2}-1) \times (N^{2}-1)$-dimensional real matrix $R$), followed by a translation (described by a vector $\overrightarrow{r}$ of dimension $N^{2}-1$): $\overrightarrow{v} \rightarrow R\overrightarrow{v}+\overrightarrow{r}$.

Here we double-counted the case where $ \alpha =\beta =\gamma =\delta $, so in total we find $4^{4}-2\times 16+1=225$ allowed values of $\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\delta $, in agreement with the dimension of $SO(15)$.}}

	Note = {Note that it is always necessary to introduce a small perturbation to select $\left|\Psi^N\right>$ as the unique ground state over a state that looks just like $\left|\Psi^N\right>$ but starts in state $\left[{0 \atop 1}\right]$ rather than in state $\left[{1 \atop 0}\right]$. This corresponds to selecting the input to the calculation to be 0 rather than 1. For a single qubit, the small perturbation $-\delta \epsilon\,\, c_{A,0,0}^{\dagger}c_{A,0,0}$ can be added to $H(1)$, where $\delta \epsilon \ll \epsilon$, to select logical 0 as the desired input to the algorithm and single out $\left\vert\Psi^{N}\right\rangle$ as the unique ground state. For multiple qubits, one simply applies this perturbation to the first row of each qubit, $-\delta \epsilon\,\, \Pi_{a=1}^{M} c_{a,0,0}^{\dagger}c_{a,0,0}$. All results in this paper are still true after the small perturbation has been introduced. See \protect\cite{Mizel:04} for details.}}

	Abstract = {We propose and evaluate experimentally an approach to quantum process tomography that completely removes the scaling problem plaguing the standard approach. The key to this simplification is the incorporation of prior knowledge of the class of physical interactions involved in generating the dynamics, which reduces the problem to one of parameter estimation. This allows part of the problem to be tackled using efficient convex methods, which, when coupled with a constraint on some parameters, allows globally optimal estimates for the Krauss operators to be determined from experimental data. Parameterizing the maps provides further advantages: it allows the incorporation of mixed states of the environment as well as some initial correlation between the system and environment, both of which are common physical situations following excitation of the system away from thermal equilibrium. Although the approach is not universal, in cases where it is valid it returns a complete set of positive maps for the dynamical evolution of a quantum system at all times.},

	Abstract = {Controlling the interaction of a single quantum system with its environment is a fundamental challenge in quantum science and technology. We strongly suppressed the coupling of a single spin in diamond with the surrounding spin bath by using double-axis dynamical decoupling. The coherence was preserved for arbitrary quantum states, as verified by quantum process tomography. The resulting coherence time enhancement followed a general scaling with the number of decoupling pulses. No limit was observed for the decoupling action up to 136 pulses, for which the coherence time was enhanced more than 25 times compared to that obtained with spin echo. These results uncover a new regime for experimental quantum science and allow us to overcome a major hurdle for implementing quantum information protocols.

For one of these, the graphical technique known as the boxplot, a selective survey of popular software packages revealed several definitions. These alternative constructions arise from different choices in computing quartiles and the fences that determine whether an observation is "outside" and thus plotted individually. We examine these alternatives and their consequences, discuss related background for boxplots (such as the probability that a sample contains one or more outside observations and the average proportion of outside observations in a sample), and offer recommendations that lead to a single standard form of the boxplot.},

A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems.

	Abstract = {We describe a quantum algorithm that solves combinatorial optimization problems by quantum simulation of a classical simulated annealing process. Our algorithm exploits quantum walks and the quantum Zeno effect induced by evolution randomization. It requires order square root of 1/d steps to find an optimal solution with bounded error probability, where d is the minimum spectral gap of the stochastic matrices used in the classical annealing process. This is a quadratic improvement over the order 1/d steps required by the latter.},

@article{brooke_tunable_2001,
	Abstract = {Perhaps the most anticipated, yet experimentally elusive, macroscopic quantum phenomenon is spin tunnelling in a ferromagnet, which may be formulated in terms of domain wall tunnelling. One approach to identifying such a process is to focus on mesoscopic systems where the number of domain walls is finite and the motion of a single wall has measurable consequences. Research of this type includes magnetotransport measurements on thin ferromagnetic wires, and magnetization experiments on single particles, nanomagnet ensembles and rare-earth multilayers. A second method is to investigate macroscopic disordered ferromagnets, whose dynamics are dominated by domain wall motion, and search the associated relaxation-time distribution functions for the signature of quantum effects. But whereas the classical, thermal processes that operate in these experiments are easily regulated via temperature, the quantum processes have so far not been tunable, making difficult a definitive interpretation of the results in terms of tunnelling. Here we describe a disordered magnetic system for which it is possible to adjust the quantum tunnelling probabilities. For this material, we can model both the classical, thermally activated response at high temperatures and the athermal, tunnelling behaviour at low temperatures within a unified framework, where the domain wall is described as a particle with a fixed mass. We show that it is possible to tune the quantum tunnelling processes by adjusting the 'mass' of this particle with an external magnetic field.},

@article{Chiaverini:04,
	Abstract = {Scalable quantum computation and communication require error control to protect quantum information against unavoidable noise. Quantum error correction protects information stored in two-level quantum systems (qubits) by rectifying errors with operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes. Error-correction protocols have been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, but the inherent limitations of this technique prevent its application to quantum information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate quantum error correction using three beryllium atomic-ion qubits confined to a linear, multi-zone trap. An encoded one-qubit state is protected against spin-flip errors by means of a three-qubit quantum error-correcting code. A primary ion qubit is prepared in an initial state, which is then encoded into an entangled state of three physical qubits (the primary and two ancilla qubits). Errors are induced simultaneously in all qubits at various rates. The encoded state is decoded back to the primary ion one-qubit state, making error information available on the ancilla ions, which are separated from the primary ion and measured. Finally, the primary qubit state is corrected on the basis of the ancillae measurement outcome. We verify error correction by comparing the corrected final state to the uncorrected state and to the initial state. In principle, the approach enables a quantum state to be maintained by means of repeated error correction, an important step towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation using trapped ions.},

@article{shor_scheme_1995,
	Abstract = {Recently, it was realized that use of the properties of quantum mechanics might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest has since been growing in the area of quantum computation. One of the main difficulties of quantum computation is that decoherence destroys the information in a superposition of states contained in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. It is shown how to reduce the effects of decoherence for information stored in quantum memory, assuming that the decoherence process acts independently on each of the bits stored in memory. This involves the use of a quantum analog of errorcorrecting codes.},

@article{Fleming2010,
	Abstract = {We provide an in-depth and thorough treatment of the validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) in an open quantum system. We find that when it is introduced after tracing out the environment all timescales of the open system are correctly reproduced, but the details of the quantum state in general will not be. The RWA made before the trace is more problematic: it results in incorrect values for environmentally induced shifts to system frequencies, and the resulting theory has no Markovian limit. In either form, the RWA gives an inaccurate quantum state which makes it inappropriate for calculating entanglement dynamics or similar detailed properties of the state dynamics. We also emphasize the fact that even under the RWA the master equation for a combination of systems and external forces is not a simple combination of the master equations of the systems and forces. Such a combination may be tempting, because the RWA guarantees that a master equation so constructed will have a valid mathematical form; however, it will not accurately reflect the dynamics of the physical system. To obtain the correct master equation for the composite system a proper consideration of the non-Markovian dynamics is required.},
